# BFOR 206 Lab
## Class 8-2: Imports


# Task Description

You can import external libraries into your
Python script. These libraries, sometimes referred to as
modules or
pa, contain classes and methods to perform
various tasks.

In this lab, we will use the `os` library to cycle through
a list of files in a directory.

# Normal Scenario

## Input
No input.

## Output
**Terminal:** The files in your current directory
with the `.py` extension.


# Test Cases

## Case 1: Output
Your output may have many other lines or different
filenames. The key is that only the `.py` files are
shown in the output.

```
8-2_class.py
functions_lab.py
```



# Submission instructions

**Scripts that produce unhandled errors will not be accepted!**

Run your script to show that it produces output that
matches the test cases.

When you are finished, submit two screenshots on Blackboard:
1.  A screenshot of your code.
2.  A screenshot of the terminal that looks very
    similar to the output in the test cases.
