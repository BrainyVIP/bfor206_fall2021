# BFOR 206 Lab
## Class 11-1: Analyzing Reddit Posts on Artificial Intelligence


# Task Description

In this lab, we will analyze the posts from
various Reddit communities that cover Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML).

The posts were curated as part of a
[Kaggle project]( https://www.kaggle.com/maksymshkliarevskyi/reddit-data-science-posts).

The purpose of this lab is to get the data loaded,
produce a random subset of 1000 rows, and print a summary of
that data.

# Normal Scenario

## Input
**Files:**  19 files from Kaggle

## Output
**Terminal:** Tables and plots as described below.


# Test Cases


## Case 1: Show Dataset Info
Print a table showing your 1000 row data frame details


Expected Output:

The numbers may vary slightly since this is using
a random sample.

|  Column         |        Non-Null Count | Dtype  |  
| :-------------  | :-------------       |     :-- |
|  Unnamed: 0         |    1000 non-null  | int64   |
| created_date     |      1000 non-null |  object    |    
|  created_timestamp   |   1000 non-null |  float64   |
| ...                 | ...     | ... |


# Submission instructions

**Scripts that produce unhandled errors will not be accepted!**

Run your script to show that it produces output that
matches the test cases.

When you are finished, submit two screenshots on Blackboard:
1.  A screenshot of your code.
2.  A screenshot of output that looks very
    similar to the output in the test cases.
