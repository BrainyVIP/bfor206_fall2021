I found some [datasets](https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Explore-the-Data/Dataset-Downloads.html) of the current bid and ask price of medical care in the U.S. for Medicare and Medicaid.

Within the dataset you can look up any hospital and see their history of bills submitted which includes their ask price of coded procedures versus the actual price paid by the govt.   A quick look at the datset shows dizzying amounts paid for service.

Currently there is no way to Google: ""how much does it cost to fix a broken leg"" or maybe ""how much does it cost to treat a concussion"".  If you are un-insured these are real Google question that gives no results.

Within this dataset, if a person know what medical code to look up they can get a rough idea of how much they will pay out of pocket for a procedure.  Costs for services can vary astronimically from hospital to hospital.  A $40,000 procedure at one hospital may be $4,000 at the hospital in the next town.  Currently there exists no way for un-insured people to shop for medicine when they need it.  This has created an extreme situation of extortion in our healthcare system.

What I would like to do with this dataset is create a map of sorts that people can use to help them shop for help with they need it the most.  Imagine Googling ""How much does it cost to fix a broken arm"" and being given a website you can use to shop around the hospitals near you.  Currently private hospitals keep the true cost of their medical procedures hidden away in ""chargemaster books"" which means we'll never know how much a hopsital profits off a birth, cancer, or broken bone, but I think this dataset can provide a strong proxy people can use to get help and have some knowledge with how much they may spend out of pocket after they're cycled into the healthcare system.  Daresay maybe some buying power at last?  In a true free market we should be able to compare prices, we should know how much medicine costs and be able to ask why one hospital charges 10x more than the other.

I don't know how I am going to apply machine learning to this problem yet but I imagine I'll be using Keras (for ML), Numpy (for stats), Pandas (for stats), and Seaborn (for stat visualization) but I don't know if there's a python library out there I can use to create the map I envision.  If there's interest in the project we can make it opensource and work on it together.  I'm passionate about this subject but I need other smart people to help me so we can fix our healthcare in America."

With PyWarm, you can put all network data flow logic in the `forward()` method of your model, without the need to define children modules in the `__init__()` method and then call it again in the `forward()`. This result in a much more readable model definition in fewer lines of code."

The obvious way to rank skaters is to take their average score of the season and rank them from highest to lowest. However, one potential problem with this approach is that the scores are averaged over different events, and no two events are the same (think different judges, ice conditions, or event altitudes). Therefore, I came up with different ranking models that can somehow tease out the skater effect (how good a skater intrinsically) from the event effect (how does an event affect the score of a skater). The models themselves are essentially just simple linear models, but I'd never thought about using linear regression this way. 
I've also documented how my models perform over the baseline model, which is the average season score model mentioned above.

If you have any feedback or ideas on my project, please don't hesitate to let me know!

PS. I'm in the process of cleaning up the code that I used for the analysis, and will soon add the link to the Github repo in the write-up. I'm writing a part 2 on even more complicated models to rank skater and will post them here when I'm done writing it."

The main idea is to separate the **skater effect**, the intrinsic ability of each skater, from the **event effect**, the influence of an event on a skater’s performance, so that a more accurate ranking could be built.

In that previous part, I considered two simple models to find the latent skater scores that are used to predict the skater ranking:

1. Score of a skater at an event = baseline score + latent skater score + latent event score 

2. Score of a skater at an event = baseline score × latent skater score × latent event score

In this part of the project ([analysis](https://github.com/dknguyengit/skate_predict/blob/master/analysis_part2.ipynb), [write-up](https://medium.com/@seismatica/predicting-figure-skating-world-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-part-2-hybrid-7d296747b15?source=friends_link&amp;sk=86881d127654ece260be2e3029dfbad2)), I consider a hybrid model of those earlier models:

**Score of a skater at an event = baseline score + latent skater score × latent event score**

Unfortunately, this model does not have a closed-form solution to learn the parameters as opposed to the earlier models. Therefore, gradient descent was used to learn them, which resulted in this neat little [animation](https://i.imgur.com/IK6AZ6W.mp4) that tracks how the model residuals, RMSE, as well as predicted ranking gets better and better as gradient descent runs. I also explore different strategies to reduce model overfit (so that it can predict skater ranking more accurately), using familiar methods such as model penalization and early stopping. 

Lastly, note that this hybrid model is nothing but factorizing the event-skater score matrix into an event-specific vector and skater-specific vector, which can multiply together to approximate the score matrix. Therefore, the gradient descent to learn the values of these latent vectors is very similar to that of the famous [FunkSVD](https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html) algorithm to learn the user-specific and item-specific latent factors, which can multiply together to approximate the rating matrix of a recommendation system (in this case user=skater, and item=event). However, FunkSVD was used with multiple factors, and in the next part of my project, I will show how multi-factor matrix factorization can be applied to this ranking problem.

The obvious method to do is by average the scores for each skater across past events and rank them by those averages. However, since no two events are the same, the goal for my project is to separate the **skater effect**, the intrinsic ability of each skater, by the **event effect**, how an event influence the score of a skater.

* I've previously posted on Reddit my attempts to do so using simple linear models, which you can read on Medium [part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-figure-skating-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-fc704fa7971a?source=friends_link&amp;sk=7e6b2992c6dd5e6e7e1803c574b4236d) of my project. These models will output a latent score for each skater that we can use to rank them.

* However, another approach to learn the latent scores of skater is to think of factorizing the event-skater matrix of raw scores in the season into a skater-specific matrix and an event-specific matrix that multiply together to approximate the raw score. Therefore, this is exactly the same as the [matrix factorization in recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems), but with user=skater, item=event, and rating=raw score.

* As a result, I used a variant of the famous [FunkSVD](https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html) algorithm to learn the latent scores of skater. In [part 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-figure-skating-world-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-part-2-hybrid-7d296747b15?source=friends_link&amp;sk=86881d127654ece260be2e3029dfbad2) of my project, I tried finding just a single latent score for each skater, and rank skaters by those scores. Next, in [part 3](https://towardsdatascience.com/predict-figure-skating-world-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-8af099351e9c?source=friends_link&amp;sk=48c2971de1a7aa77352eb96eec77f249), I learned multiple latent factors for each skater using the same FunkSVD method. Since I'm implementing it from scratch, I try using various implementations of the algorithm: from a naive approach using for loop, to one using numpy broadcasting, and one using matrix multiplication, and benchmark them both in time and space complexity.

* However, one major problem with multiple factors is that it's hard to know which factor to rank skater with. Thankfully, the ranking metric I use in the project (Kendall's tau) allows me to build a simple logistic regression model to combine these scores to rank the skaters. This can be done with pairwise differences in score in each factor as predictors, and the world championship ranking itself as the response. I later learned that this belong to the pairwise [learning-to-rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank) methods often encountered in information system, and you can read my implementation of it in [part 4](https://medium.com/@seismatica/predict-figure-skating-world-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-a4771f2460d2?source=friends_link&amp;sk=61ecc86c4340e2e3095720cae80c0e70). 

* However, the result at the end of this part was not very encouraging, likely due to the way that I use FunkSVD to train the latent factors. Therefore, I [part 5](https://medium.com/@seismatica/predict-figure-skating-world-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-7461dc5c0722?source=friends_link&amp;sk=fcf7e410d33925363d0bbbcf59130ade), I modified my FunkSVD implementation to solve this problem, by training the factors in sequence instead of all at once. I then discovered afterward that Mr Funk also originally trained all of his factors in sequence, so I should have read his work more carefully at the start!

You can see all the code I used for my project in the Github [repo](https://github.com/dknguyengit/skate_predict). I'm more than happy to receive any questions or feedback from you guys on my project!"

When we started out, we were charging users by the hour. Users would pay $120-$200/hr to get trained by coaches on the platform for data science and software positions. This prevented a lot of job seekers from using our service as they felt the cost was prohibitive. We tried convincing that the investment would be worth it but they just weren't convinced. We had practically no growth for a month or so. We then decided that we had to align incentives. So, we introduced Income Share Agreements (ISAs).  Users now only paid us if and when they get a job (8% of first year’s base salary). But when we decided to implement ISAs, we had no idea how to start. We were still in college and didn't have much money to hire a lawyer. So, we ended up using Purdue University's ISA as a template for ours. Of course, the ISA we had written up had a ton of loopholes but again, we didn't have any money to set something up with a lawyer. Thankfully, we got into the NYU Stern Venture Fellows program and got some money through an angel through the program. That allowed us to hire lawyers and set up a partnership with a third party ISA provider.

And hold on, support for more datasets and more types is on the way. Feel free to contribute and add datasets. Also, looking for experienced developers who can contribute to the architecture of the project or provide reviews for improvement.

In this project, we will implement customer segmentation in R. Whenever you need to find your best customer, customer segmentation is the ideal methodology.

In this machine learning project, DataFlair will provide you the background of customer segmentation. Then we will explore the data upon which we will be building our segmentation model. Also, in this data science project, we will see the descriptive analysis of our data and then implement several versions of the K-means algorithm. So, follow the complete data science customer segmentation project using machine learning in R and become a pro in [***Data Science***](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-tutorials-home/).

## Customer Segmentation Project in R

Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of [***K-means clustering***](https://data-flair.training/blogs/k-means-clustering-tutorial/) which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled dataset. Before ahead in this project, learn what actually customer segmentation is. [Read More](https://data-flair.training/blogs/r-data-science-project-customer-segmentation/)"

In this project, we will implement customer segmentation in R. Whenever you need to find your best customer, customer segmentation is the ideal methodology.

In this machine learning project, DataFlair will provide you the background of customer segmentation. Then we will explore the data upon which we will be building our segmentation model. Also, in this data science project, we will see the descriptive analysis of our data and then implement several versions of the K-means algorithm. So, follow the complete data science customer segmentation project using machine learning in R and become a pro in [***Data Science***](https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-tutorials-home/).

## Customer Segmentation Project in R

Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of [***K-means clustering***](https://data-flair.training/blogs/k-means-clustering-tutorial/) which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled dataset.

I have this idea of medical chatbot where you could write in symptoms&amp;signs of disease and a probable initial diagnosis would pop up.

I have so far a simple sequential model with super simple GUI in Python which gets fed by data stored in a json file (it's a retrieval-based chatbot as of now).

To be honest, I just followed some tutorial, but I'd love bring it onto a new level and make it publicly available, eventually.

Summary

A deep learning model which accurately classifies the names of businesses/organisations and people/individuals, even when input data has misspellings and typos that were not present in the training data.

When parsing real-world poor quality data, sometimes necessary to classify whether the entity in a ""name"" field corresponds to an organisation or a person. Common approaches to classify names in this context are:

Rules based systems e.g. searching for terms such as ""Mrs."" or ""Ltd.""

ML classifier models which learn the probability of word tokens taken from a labelled set of business/individual names

Neither of these approaches are resiliant when dealing with poor data quality e.g. misspellings and typos, as this effectively introduces new tokens which were not present in the training data - e.g. the model has no way to infer that the business ""Tom's Conputers"" is similar to the phrase ""Jack's Computers"" that was included in the training set.

This model uses a character/byte level deep learning model, meaning it can infer that unseen words such as ""Conputers"" are similar to the word ""Computers"" that it has trained on. This also has the advantage that the model could be trained on words with non-latin characters with little modification, resulting in a global name classification model.

Technical Details

Uses a character/byte-level deep learning model (LSTM trained in Tensorflow). The model was trained on approximately 7 million unique business names from LinkedIn, and 7 million distinct individuals names from IMDB.

It achieved a 95% accuracy (F1 score) based upon a held-out validation set from the same distribution.

When typos/spelling mistakes are introduced into the test set, simulated by deleting two characters at random from each test item (without changing the training data/retraining with misspelled data), the model achieves with 86% accuracy (F1 score)."

Dear all,

I’m trying to analyse .eml attachments in a specific mailbox in PowerBI. So far, I’ve taken the following steps:

1. Add source: Microsoft Exchange Online
2. Expand Attachment content (binary)
3. Filter out non-eml attachments (extension=.eml)
4. Install Python, and the following packages: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, eml_parser
5. Test eml_parser outside PowerBI (documentation here: https://pypi.org/project/eml-parser)

The script works like a charm and the link between PowerBI and Microsoft Exchange Online is amazingly easy and smooth.

I just can’t get the eml_parser to analyse the contents of a column rather than .eml-files. 

I’ve spent so much time investigating this... please help me take the last steps!!!"

There's currently an online AI Hackathon running by Facebook ([https://fbai1.devpost.com/](https://fbai1.devpost.com/)) which is due in 14 days now. I've already won a hackathon and have a medical chat-bot which I'm re-writting into PyTorch (\~80% done) for this one. I'm looking for some experienced team buddies who would help me with the PyTorch implementation and to make the chat-bot better.

As of now, it's a simple retrieval chat-bot based on NN with a json file as a knowledge base. I think, some kind of memory, so it can answer consequent questions (like ""What should I do?"", ""Am I going to die?"" etc.) and ability to go/scrape data from medical portals, so that the data doesn't need to be filled into the json file manually, would be great. 

So, if you think we would make for a good team, feel free to drop me DM!

Cheers!"

I have done the data fetching part with the available python Instagram API where I store the post captions and comments of Instagram posts and store them in a text file. I am currently working on the data preprocessing and data cleansing part knowby using puthon NLP but I am pretty much lost after this. I don't know how to proceed any further. I guess I need to implement deep learning here but I am pretty much new to all this. My knowledge is limited to basics of machine learning for now :(

This project is somewhat similar to sentiment analysis but here we are categorizing the text into various emotions that are present instead of just finding the polarity of the text (positive, negative, neutral). I want to classify a textual data based on six basic emotions that are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sad and surprise. 

Pls help."

I have been banned from r/learningprogramming today  because somehow you can somehow 'spam' a community with content that gets upvoted 100+ times, while memes survive.

Last year I was removed from r/datascience because I posted content that got upvoted 300+ times (by there own community members). 

They banned me for these 'tainted' posts:

**Tainted Posts:**

&amp;#x200B;

This somehow amounted to spam according to the moderators. While this 'great' content was allowed around the same time:

&amp;#x200B;

I have not once been banned for a reason that doesn't cause me to chuckle. Its all so petty and absurd, over-moderation honestly sucks. But like democracy, Reddit seems to be the least worst form of  sharing content."

The new world gets a lot of its direction from data science, which should not be surprising when considering the vast amounts of data that flow into organizations across sectors. From giants such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google, to those much smaller in size, the data science industry has a number of takers. This also explains why the jobs of data science professionals are among the most demanded in the digital era.

Extreme precision, high accuracy and excellent team are the key constituents for a team to participate and win the grand prix.

All the major teams like Scuderia Ferrari, McLaren, Redbull, Renault and numerous others compete for the world championship. As data science enthusiast and huge fan of Formula1, I thought of analyzing the Formula1 dataset from Kaggle which provided the open dataset that in turn provided us with numerous data attributes like Formula1 drivers, races, lap timings, seasons data, pitstop status and other related attributes.

My quarantine project is to make it easier to turn a piece of code into an API. This means spending more time on models and less time on Dev Ops to turn models into APIs.

So, essentially, I'm making a simple interface to turn code/models into an API, with deployment, database management, security rules, SSL configuration and other tedious steps and decisions abstracted away.

**It works like this:**  
Step 1: Upload file containing code/model.  
Step 2: Define URL structure and decide if this API call is a GET, POST, PUT, etc.  
Step 3: Deploy to [yourdomain.zapi.io](https://yourdomain.zapi.io/)

**And it looks like this:**

So I have been working on a machine learning project for stock predictions and wanted to implement a dash app whereby I use a dataset of historical stock data and the user can select a variety of technical indicators (Moving Average etc) and apply them to a chart of the close prices. 

I have seen one example but was wondering if anyone has come across something similar. 

The example uses QuantMod which I have not come across before but the design/functionality is similar to what I image: select a stock, select the technical indicators. I was hoping I could just use TA-lib.

I have with data from the last 4 years (2016-2019), and have data for individual customers every day, and on different ""packages"" of the same product. Let's assume our product is a ""newspaper"".
What my boss would like to know is if we make a price increase of 10% or 20%, how many customers we lose on the back of it.

There will naturally be customers we lose due to natural oversights that they have no time, desire or a 3rd thing.

Price Change:
-We'll send out a message about a price change a month before it happens.
-We make the price change

I am open to all ideas.
Preferably with some details on how you would approach the problem, and if you have more than one, i welcome those too. 

I can use all kinds of methods and programs, but would prefer to work with python."

Alright, so I just went through some ANN codes I developed on Python and R; when I got my results for my stock market prediction, I do wonder if I can rely on these results to make decisions:

1. I just used the most fundamental feature which is ***% of*** ***ROI*** for each day from several years; but from my POV, even if I do put in more data (e.g. sentiment features, etc.), how could an ML model predict the stock market correctly when there are just ***so many things that can change*** in its environment?
2. Suppose, even if it has 70-80% accuracy and used K-fold testing or whatnot, this is based on ***the data it's trained on - isn't this an artificial and risky conclusion?***
3. And if we really want to believe the result, the investor ***really need to believe*** ***in the theory*** of ""efficient market hypothesis"" where it states past data can tell future data's performance? - as I progress through these ML methods, I am certainly more inclined that the market is based on the random walk theory, thus no correct pattern can be predicted in future? (because it (i.e. the ML results and the mechanism that gave the results) just doesn't make sense to me)

I understand that ANN (regardless of its variance), uses ""weights"" to detect pattern from the dataset (the dataset can be anything from pictures, financial data, etc.); thus this is how ANN learns i.e. it goes through some iterations to update the weights until the error reaches some acceptable value. Once we understand what weights randomisation, local minima, gradient descent, the need to have very large data for training, etc., the trader may see the limits of MLs such as ANN, and I think the model alone is not enough (and expensive) to make the call for buying/ selling stocks?

Or am I missing something here?"

So I am creating a Dash application and have created my first page and getting to grips with it. 

On the 2nd page, I want to be able to demonstrate various different ML models for my project but have a few questions I hope some people with more Dash Plotly experience can answer.

How I imagine it is that the user can select the dataset (by typing in a Stock), selecting a ML model i.e. LSTM, Xgboost, SVR and then it displays the test vs predicted graph and the models metrics i.e. mse, mae. 

My worries are firstly is it possible to do this. The training time for these models can be up to 30/40 minutes so that's a problem. And how the models can actually be implemented, for example the xgboost model is completely different to the lstm.

When I first thought of the idea it seemed simple but now I am worried I cannot produce this, I need to somehow demonstrate these models and the only way I could think was to let the user select the model, produce a graph and metrics. 

If someone could give me some pointers or possible solutions I'd be really grateful."

And we wanted to collect the statistics of how good is the model at jokes.

For this purpose, we created a [Telegram bot](https://t.me/PMLDL_jokeskek_bot), where you can test the model.

Currently, if you type a \\joke  
 command bot randomly returns joke either from one of the trained models, or one of the datasets. But if you want to get the joke from the model directly, just write the question (without the command) and the model will generate the answer to it.

So, if you're looking for some cringe at synthetic jokes, you're welcome)  
Also, please rate the jokes, so we could gather better statistics.  
Thanks for your help!

P.S. As for the code and datasets, you can look at them in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kzvdar42/Joke-Generator-Bot)."

To date, researchers and medical professionals have identified [several risk factors](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html__;!!May37g!biBASlgqDM1DQeYZMJg6SgpUIiHYW89ujpWyQ3cxFXwQ9lLozXXzrGxUsXvgE7o$) that are associated with greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19, but additional research is needed to better understand the impact these factors have on high-risk individuals. The Veteran population, in particular, has a higher prevalence of several of the known risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. To improve our understanding of the risk and protective factors in the Veteran population, the [VHA Innovation Ecosystem](https://www.va.gov/innovationecosystem/) is utilizing the [precisionFDA](https://precision.fda.gov/) platform to call upon the public to develop machine learning and artificial intelligence models to predict health outcomes using synthetic Veteran health records.

If you would like to learn more about the challenge and how the VHA Innovation Ecosystem and precisionFDA are working together to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes, please visit the [challenge site](https://go.usa.gov/xvzzh)! Pre-registration for the challenge opens today, and the challenge submission period runs from June 1st through July 1st.

If you have any questions about the challenge, precisionFDA, or the VHA Innovation Ecosystem, please feel free to post them in this thread, and we will respond as quickly as possible."

for an University project me and another classmate developed a spreading disease simulation tool in golang and python.

[https://github.com/carbogninalberto/spreading-disease-simulation](https://github.com/carbogninalberto/spreading-disease-simulation)

**TL;DR:** there are a lot of customizable parameters, Containment Measures (mask and social distacing), impact on National Healthcare System and many more features...

&amp;#x200B;

The software is able to create and allocate a big graph using a relative low amount of RAM; by default the graph consist of around 4mln nodes and 150 edges per node, note that 32gb RAM is needed. Generally you can use a 400k nodes 150 edges with around 4 gb ram usage; if you suggest some feedback to reduce the amount of usage is appreciated.

We provide a simple Montecarlo Simulation that consists on running multiple time the spreading simulation, collect data and save them on a csv.

After that we run a python script to calculate confidence intervals with Asymptotic Formulas and Bootstrap algorithm. As final step the script plot some matplotlib graphs of the measured metrics.

[https://github.com/firmai/datagene](https://github.com/firmai/datagene)

DataGene is developed to identify dataset similarity between real and synthetic datasets as well as train, test, and validation datasets. For many modelling and software development tasks there is a need for datasets to have share similar characteristics. This has traditionally been achieved with visualisations, DataGene seeks to replace these visual methods with a range of novel quantitative methods. Please see the GitHub repository to inspect and install the code.

If you work with synthetic and generated datasets, this tool can be extremely useful. It is also helpful if you train models and want to ensure your training, validation, and test sets have similar characteristics.

The framework includes transformation from tensors, matrices, and vectors.  It includes a range of encodings and decompositions such as Gramian Angular Encoding, Recurrence Plot, Markov Transition Fields, Matrix Product State, CANDECOMP, and Tucker Decompositions.

After encoding and decoding transformations have been performed, you can choose from a range of distance metrics to calculate the similarity across various datasets.

In addition to the 30 or so transformations, there are 15 distance methods. The first iteration, focuses on time series data. All feedback appreciated. GitHub [link](https://github.com/firmai/datagene), Colab [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QSDTKvNiwc1IRCX_VYr9TRFusdX1gLMM?usp=sharing)

It starts off with transformations:

    datasets = [org, gen_1, gen_2]
    
    def transf_recipe_1(arr):
      return (tran.pipe(arr)[tran.mrp_encode_3_to_4]()
                [tran.mps_decomp_4_to_2]()
                [tran.gaf_encode_2_to_3]()
                [tran.tucker_decomp_3_to_2]()
                [tran.qr_decomp_2_to_2]()
                [tran.pca_decomp_2_to_1]()
                [tran.sig_encode_1_to_2]()).value
    
    recipe_1_org,recipe_1_gen_1,recipe_1_gen_2 = transf_recipe_1(datasets)

This operation chains 7 different transformations across all datasets in a given list. Output dimensions are linked to input dimensions. In the example above, Multivariate Recurrence Plots (mrp) are a way to visualise the behavior of a trajectory of a dynamical system in phase space. Matrix-product state (mps) are the de facto standard for the representation of one-dimensional quantum many body states. A Gramian Angular Field (gaf) is an image obtained from a time series, representing some temporal correlation between each time point. Tucker (tucker) decomposition decomposes a tensor into a set of matrices and one small core tensor. The QR decomposition (qr) of a matrix is a decomposition of the matrix into an orthogonal matrix and a triangular matrix. Principal component analysis (pca) is a mathematical algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the data set. The signature method (sig) is a transformation of a path into a sequence that encapsulates summaries of the path

After encoding and decoding transformations have been performed, you can choose from a range of distance metrics to calculate the similarity across datasets.

## Model (Mixed)

The model includes a transformation from tensor/matrix (the input data) to the local shapley values of the same shape, as well as tranformations to prediction vectors, and feature rank vectors.

`dist.regression_metrics()` \- Prediction errors metrics.

`mod.shapley_rank()` \+ `dist.boot_stat()` \- Statistical feature rank correlation.

`mod.shapley_rank()` \- Feature direction divergence. (NV)

`mod.shapley_rank()` \+ `dist.stat_pval()` \- Statistical feature divergence significance. (NV)

## Matrix

Transformations like Gramian Angular Field, Recurrence Plots, Joint Recurrence Plot, and Markov Transition Field, returns an image from time series. This makes them perfect candidates for image similarity measures. From this matrix section, only the first three measures, take in images, they have been tagged (IMG). From what I know, image similarity metrics have not yet been used on 3D time series data. Furthermore, correlation heatmaps, and 2D KDE plots, and a few others, also work fairly well with image similarity metrics.

`dist.ssim_grey()` \- Structural grey image similarity index. (IMG)

`dist.image_histogram_similarity()` \- Histogram image similarity. (IMG)

`dist.hash_simmilarity()` \- Hash image similarity. (IMG)

`dist.distance_matrix_tests()` \- Distance matrix hypothesis tests. (NV)

`dist.entropy_dissimilarity()` \- Non-parametric entropy multiples. (NV)

`dist.matrix_distance()` \- Statistical and geometrics distance measures.

## Vector

`dist.pca_extract_explain()` \- PCA extraction variance explained. (NV)

`dist.vector_distance()` \- Statistical and geometric distance measures.

`dist.distribution_distance_map()` \- Geometric distribution distances feature map.

`dist.curve_metrics()` \- Curve comparison metrics. (NV)

`dist.curve_kde_map()` \- dist.curve\_metrics kde feature map. (NV)

`dist.vector_hypotheses()` \- Vector statistical tests."

TIA. I will be glad if someone gets helped from this. Also, I intend to write up a similar post for the other tasks and some custom training and stuff like that. I will update in this thread about this if people like this one!"

I am not yet a student so i teach it my self and still want to learn a lot of stuff.

  
I used pandas and whoosh ( text search / indexing ) and analyzed over 200,000 news articles so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

[The amount of daily news articles. Right now ca. 1200 new articles per day.](https://preview.redd.it/8e36jzwrqth51.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b160252b3ac2fc113195e5f2e86e42d01242f50)

One can see at the start of the year i downloaded just a few but chose more and more publisher over the time. The wave form is because of the weekends where publisher tend to produce less articles. Aswell as some database issues in the middle of May for example. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[In these graphs I showed the percentage of news that had certain keywords in their title over time.](https://preview.redd.it/ux0y3yfjqth51.png?width=1295&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3e9cfd1fda81f4afc4b3b000fe43c4d1898e3f3)

I am from Germany so Hanau and Tönnies is probably unknown for international people. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[One does not simply collect news in 2020 without mentioning corona](https://preview.redd.it/8h4kbl4gtth51.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f16c3b165fa7bbf547f40139364aec04e9fb302)

Furthermore I used the python plugin wordloud to generate this tag. I counted the appearence of every word in news where the title had ""corona or covid"" in it. This wordcloud visualizes this by making words that appear often bigger and fat. 

But this also might be irrelevant if you cant read some german words.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did alot of other stuff with the data obviously but I think there are way more possibilities than i could imagine right now. For example one idea of mine is to set each word in relation to every other word and create a huge map to see how often words appear together. But I am too inexperienced to even know how to start this. I mean i counted words and stuff to create the wordcloud tag, but my idea seems a little more complicated.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. If you have anything to say about this, have more topics to search and especially cool ideas what I can do with my data, then please leave a comment :)

Have a nice day"

Knowledge distillation has been used primarily to compress deep learning models but recently has found applications in tasks such as improving robustness of models as well.  
[KD\_Lib](https://github.com/SforAiDl/KD_Lib) is a modular open-source PyTorch library to facilitate knowledge distillation (KD) for custom deep learning models. The inspiration behind developing this library was the absence of any comprehensive framework allowing users to train their models using KD easily. KD\_Lib takes care of the entire distillation training process and has a vey simple and intuitive API. It contains a variety of methods from a collection of prominent research papers which can be used with a few lines of code.

The library is still under development and we seek your suggestions and feedback to make it better.  
We hope KD\_Lib can help users in efficiently incorporating knowledge distillation in their work."

Working on model selection in logistic regression with dummy variables in R, currently I have 6 explanatory variables (coded as 21 dummies). In running the logistic regression (using backwards stepwise selection), I get a very high accuracy on my testing data (96.5%), although some variables in the model are insignificant. Removing some of the insignificant variables results in some of the significant variables becoming insignificant and worse prediction accuracy (as well as higher AIC and lower log likelihood). 

Does this mean there is collinearity in my model? If so, should I include interaction terms? How would I go about analysing this?"

If your reading this and are able to answer any of the questions below I would be extremely grateful.  


&amp;#x200B;

1. There are a lot of options, Markov chains appear a lot in the literature, but then again so do Shapley values, bagged logistic regression, multivariate point process, Hidden Markov models, and others. I'm sure it will become clearer with time, but I'm not sure what the best option would be. I need to be able to validate my decision in the report, but currently cant see the wood for the trees! Could anyone provide any insight into the benefits of particular models or the best way to be thinking about things? 
2. When it comes to tuning/ fitting the models to KPIs, would this be done in a machine learning sense where you trained the model with data on KPIs before and after a channel has been added (or had more spent on it), then tested it by having it make a prediction on how much a channel would contribute to a KPI, and comparing its prediction to the actual KPI, and doing that a bunch of times until its predictions were good?
3. Would there be different models for different KPIs?

  
I ultimately want to be able to ask the model will adding X channel have an effect on Y KPI.   


If anyone can provide any useful insight that I haven't explicitly asked about, I would also be very grateful for that.

I am a complete data science/engineering/analysis amateur but very interested. I have some basic python skills (probably better described as some basic programming skills but I have used python before), a keen desire to learn and a potential data set I'd like to play with. I have a (relatively) technical background but no real experience with data up to know

The data set is currently an excel spreadsheet that spans just over 2000 rows across about 10-12 columns. It is a complete list of Strictly Come Dancing scores for all couples across all dances from all judges, including the type of dance (samba, tango etc) and the song, ranging from season 1 to 17.

I'm looking for advice on the steps to take to structure the data in a way that easily allows me to interrogate/query the data with specific questions. 

I have already played with Excel's pivot tables with some success, but I get the feeling that I could format this data better to help answer more questions. 

For example, the table currently has a column containing the scores from each judge - but that doesn't help me when the answer to the question I'm asking today is ""*which judge first gave a score of 10 in season 5?*""

Any help anyone can offer around what to learn/read/practice that could help me turn a 2D table into a more useful data structure and any tools/processes to help me exploit the data would be very much appreciated. 

Apologies if I'm in the wrong sub, let me know if I need to move this!"

The recent advent of high-throughput sequencing of lymphocyte antigen receptor genes has generated unprecedented opportunities for the exploration of adaptive immune responses. With these opportunities, however, have come significant challenges in understanding the appropriate analysis techniques that improve the understanding of the roles of genetic variabilities play in the individual immune response to this viral infection. 

Through this App-a-thon, participants will enhance informatics analysis tools and develop innovative applications and pipelines that will illuminate the relationship between personalized adaptive immunity molecular data and COVID-19 disease variables and associated factors. This will empower healthcare professionals with evidence-based data and tools to expedite treatment options for severe COVID-19 illness. 

The App-a-thon submission period opens on November 30th and closes on January 29th. For more information and to pre-register, visit the app-a-thon site [here](https://go.usa.gov/x7ph4)!"

If this is not suitable can it be adapted or are there other methods with similar accuracy level?,kxrlqg,Flewizzle,,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascienceproject/comments/kxrlqg/suitability_of_causal_impact_r_package_for_a_plug/,1.0,0.0,0.0,4110.0,"I am a final year undergraduate student who has been tasked with making a causal impact/inference model for a digital marketing agency as part of my final year project at university. The company has asked for a simple user interface that allows for data tables to be uploaded, a few settings adjusted (suitable for 'semi-layman') , and then outputs a metric for the impact of some marketing activity on a KPI.   


I found something that looks like it gives a good output, which is the Causal Impact package within R. However my research so far show that this is quite hands on as it requires adding 10 -20 control variables to deal with bias etc, although the result would be great the company may not be happy with this method as its not plug and play.   


Can anyone offer advice on if this kind of method can be adapted to fit the above criteria? or if there are alternative methods that fit the criteria? I have posted similar things about this in the past and people have commented saying the offer services that do the above, but I am specifically looking to do it myself and get quite hands on in putting it all together as its for a project.  


Any advice would be very much appreciated! Thanks"

Happy Friday! Hope you're all hanging in. We are looking for participants for a data science competition we're running right now over at: [https://www.proptechchallenge.com/nyserda-tenant-energy-data](https://www.proptechchallenge.com/nyserda-tenant-energy-data)

As background, large NYC office buildings saw their occupancy rates drop by 90% on average last year due to COVID-19, but their energy consumption only dropped by 30%. While lease obligations and healthcare protocols contributed, there is still surprising room for previously unknown vampiric loads within these buildings. We now refer to this circumstance as **the Great Energy Disconnect**. 

Rather than leave it to the usual suspects (NYC building owners, managers, and their consultants), **the PropTech Challenge aims to democratize access** to the Great Energy Disconnect. Our website has **over 2.5 years of real-world data** from a Midtown Manhattan office building and the headquarters of a publicly traded tenant available for download. 

We are challenging data scientists and modeling enthusiasts to use our test set to **predict actual electricity consumption** in this headquarters on 8/31/2020 (the day after the test set ends). **Submissions are due by March 26, 2021** via upload on our website. The most accurate, eligible predictions will **win $5k cash**. 

Our test set has been downloaded **over 75 times by teams in 35 cities and towns on 5 continents** so far. We'd greatly appreciate your advice and assistance doubling these figures before our deadline! Solving the Great Energy Disconnect is crucial if New York is to achieve its climate leadership goals. Please join the fight!

Thank you in advance!"

Since few months ago, i've been studying Python, SQL, and some skills in Data Analysis and Data Science.  Also, i've been creating some projects in data analysis and scraping. 

However, I want to get an academic program (some validation program/certificate) from a college in Data Analysis, Data science, Data Analytics, Software development or something related to those fields. 

I've been doing some research, and i've found that the colleges offers minor and major degrees, associates degrees and certificates.. and want your opinion and advice for the followings: 

1. What program do you recommend to me? A minor, major, associate or a certificate? I have low incomes, so, for semester i just can pay $2000 or less. 

2. What colleges do you recommend to me in Utah, preferably in Salt Lake City?

I've used TensorFlow 2.0 since its release and I realized how much of a difference in model prototyping does its Functional API make. The basic idea of functional API in TF can be read [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional)

Since I'll using PyTorch for some time now, I've decided to create a project that provides similar API for PyTorch. If you are familiar with functional API from TF, my implementation will will be familiar to you.

You can read the README and source code on [github](https://github.com/gahaalt/pytorch-functional-api)

Also, you can download the package with PyPI \`pip install pytorch-functional\`.

A quick start would be to create a model and play with it:
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; from torch import nn
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pytorch_functional import Input, FunctionalModel

&gt;&gt;&gt; inputs = Input(shape=(3, 32, 32))
&gt;&gt;&gt; inputs.shape
(None, 3, 32, 32)

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = inputs
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x(nn.Conv2d(x.channels, 16, 3))
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x(nn.Conv2d(x.channels, 16, 3))
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x(nn.Flatten())
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x(nn.Linear(x.features, 10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.shape
(None, 10)

&gt;&gt;&gt; model = FunctionalModel(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; model
FunctionalModel(
  (module000_depth001): Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
  (module001_depth002): Conv2d(16, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
  (module002_depth003): Flatten(start_dim=1, end_dim=-1)
  (module003_depth004): Linear(in_features=12544, out_features=10, bias=True)
)

&gt;&gt;&gt; model.output_shape
(None, 10)
```

As you can see, with functional API there's no need to count output shapes for intermediate layers by yourself, since symbolic variables calculate it when creating layers.

You should be able to create any acyclic network with this API, including multiple input/output ones. For more information go to [github](https://github.com/gahaalt/pytorch-functional-api) and if you face any problems, please leave an Issue there."
