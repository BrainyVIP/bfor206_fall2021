I am a new Kaggle user and I am wondering if there is any way of allowing the code to run for longer times in a kernel only submission?

My model (a stacked LSTM) takes a while to train, and it seems that for the competition, I can only submit a kernel and letting it run for 60 minutes (then it times out). 

The model is no way near full convergence and it is really frustrating fight against the timer, modifying the code so that it can preprocess the data, train the model, and finish the prediction in time.

I am wondering if there is any way around this? Or this is just the nature of a ""kernel-only"" competition?"

I assume it's some kind of score which measures how far you are from the right prediction. Maybe the +x is how many values I have overestimated more than a certain threshold and the -y how many values I have underestimated.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I still can't understand it. My first version had (+9/-9) and a public score of 0.11641 while my second version had a lower ""rating"" (+2/-2) but got a worse public score of 0.12295

We're working with Kaggle to run this challenge in preparation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). LSST will be revolutionary, and will find 10--100 times more time-varying astronomical sources than we've ever seen. This will enable all sorts of scientific studies we've simply not been able to do thus far, as well as make existing measurements more robust. But first we've got to identify what each source is... in a nightly volume of data that is the digital equivalent of the US Library of Congress. So far, astronomical classification has been largely visual, but that approach will not scale, and we're looking for novel approaches from the community -- you!  


The challenge has a couple of starter kit kernels to help with astrophysical domain knowledge and introduce you to the sort of approaches astronomers have taken to solve similar problems. It's also got a few features that are unusual compared to regular Kaggle challenges, and in that sense is a bit of an experiment for Kaggle too:

* The training and testing sets are heavily imbalanced - the Universe doesn't produce equal numbers of sources
* The training set may not even be completely representative - we tend to be able to visually classify only a subset of sources that we find as is
* There might be objects in the test set that aren't present in the training set at all - we expect LSST to find sources that we've never even seen before

We're really excited about the challenge, and it is a way for the community to have a real influence on the survey design of LSST, and therefore the sort of science we'll be doing in the next decade. We hope you'll take part, and best of luck to you!

The post is specific  CareerCon Competition for Predicting the surface on which a robot is traversing using IMU sensor data.

I didn't see any of the Public Kernels using the group id's data other than making use of it for validation split in GroupShuffleSplit or GroupKFolds.

So i decided to come up with a model that reduces the modelling of group-specific patterns from the data and generalize well by focusing on surface-specific patterns in the data.

The basic idea is to do pair-wise comparison on random pairs from the training data and make the model predict if they belong to the same group and/or surface.

Here's a link to the Kernel : [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/abdurrafae/using-group-id-s-the-right-way)

We are researchers from the University of Washington, looking for participants to be interviewed for a study about collaboration in Kaggle competitions. 

We are interested in speaking with people who have participated in at least one Kaggle competition, and/or have engaged in any collaborative activities during a competition. Those collaborative activities might include but are not limited to participating in competition-related discussions online, sharing code/results, and/or helping others who are not on your team. We are interested in how and why people collaborate with each other during such competitions. 

The interview study will last approximately 15-60 minutes, which you may stop at any time. The interview will take place via an online video or voice call with one of the researchers. Although there will be no financial compensation for participation, we will be grateful for your time and input. 

If you are interested in participating in our study, please fill in this screening survey and follow the instructions in the survey: [https://forms.gle/DxJcgDhbH2EJHD4X6](https://forms.gle/DxJcgDhbH2EJHD4X6)

I have recently used the Titanic dataset from kaggle ( [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) ) and built a machine learning model for the competition - **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.** With the given training dataset, I built the model and the Random Forest Classifier I used gave 83% accuracy on validation dataset (accuracy is the evaluation metric required by the competition). So, I generated predictions for the test data and submitted the output. But the competition scoreboard gave me 0.0000 score. From the other answers in Kaggle forums, I read that the [score gives the percentage of correct predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/anomaly-detection-challenges-2015-challenge-2/discussion/17376) for the test data. So, it means none of my predictions are correct.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

How could that happen, despite a decent accuracy on validation dataset? And I am seeing only 1.000 and 0.000 in the scoreboard. How is the categorization accuracy calculated?

As a starting point we can do some basic competitions/tutorials, look at existing datasets (to analyze them and do kernels) etc. I just feel that together it will be easier to consistently grow and push each other into doing more. 

As means of communication we can create a slack channel, this would probably be the best option but anyways just ping me and we will decide. Also I am living in Berlin and if somebody wants to meet in person to do some stuff I am all in.  
A little background. I have 3+ years in iOS mobile development where I did many different architectures/projects (from apps that do a lot of SQLite synchronization stuff to heavy UI projects with cool animations etc). Recently understood that I want to gradually switch to data science. So in the company I am working right now I started helping with some research and visualization stuff apart from my mobile development projects.

What I can do (or know):

\- know basic Python stuff: pandas, numpy etc

\- pretty basic understanding of machine learning models

\- experienced in software architecture/patterns/clean code (though it is not really needed for data science at least in data analysis/competitions :-)"

&amp;#x200B;

I am confused about the concept of committing Kernels in combination with the write permissions of the input directory.

Currently, I work with the [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data) Dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**1.** I added the Dataset to my Notebook.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.**  Subsequently, I just extracted the zip files into the '../working' directory

&amp;#x200B;

`with ZipFile('../input/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/train.zip') as zipobj:`

`zipobj.extractall('../working')`

&amp;#x200B;

**3.**  After this, I sorted the data by class and applied a Datagenerator with flow\_from\_directory().

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Until this point, everything works fine. But when I want to commit my Kernel I would like to see my Saved Model in the Output section.

What actually happens is, that Kaggle starts to plot all the images from the Dataset. I understand, that I saved the Images into the working directory, but I have no permission to save it into the input directory.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody know, how to deal with it?

Datasets sourced and models built for this competition may also help address [**key open scientific questions**](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks) on COVID-19. Some examples include:

* [**What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?**](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=587) Collecting rich datasets of policy actions taken and when they were taken (school closures, cancelling large gatherings, stay-at-home, etc.) and measuring their impact on downstream infection rates will be important to forward forecast of case volumes and answering this question
* [**What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?**](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=568) Data feeding into predictive models on transmission probabilities and incubation times may also help address this
* [**What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?**](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=558) Data to forecast severe cases that are likely to lead to fatalities across regions of varying demographics will also help enlighten COVID-19 risk factors
* [**What has been published about medical care?**](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=572) Data on local healthcare system capacity, approaches, and results for COVID-19 patients will be helpful to understand if and when hospital systems will be strained, and how systems can optimize care

Last fall I helped to host the [Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.kaggle.com/c/3d-object-detection-for-autonomous-vehicles/overview) competition.

In the past month, I had 3 discussions with people that are thinking about creating a machine learning competition for their company. To save time for people that are also interested in the topic I will write a blog post that summarizes my experience.

To do a better job I need your help. Could you please write questions about hosting the competition in the comments?

Any questions will work: Smart, stupid, provocative :)

To start:

1. How much does it cost to host the competition at Kaggle?
2. Why prize money becomes smaller every year?
3. How does Kaggle check the data before the competition?
4. How should the organizer promote the competition?
5. How to engage the academic audience?
6. Why do we have data leaks?
7. What happens if the organizer wants the metric that Kaggle does not have?
8. Do winning solutions go to production?
9. Should organizers write an academic paper about the results of the competition?
10. Do hiring managers look at the top competitors?
11. How to prepare the data for a competition?
12. How to estimate what type of hardware is necessary?
13. What are the other things that should be prepared except the data?

etc  
I do not know the answer to many of them, but I have a few ideas that I would like to share.

The dataset contains thousands of [quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes) scraped from [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/).  
Each quote is associated with one or more popular tags from a set of fourteen.  
You can use this dataset for natural language classification and generation tasks.  
The dataset will be expanded in the future with a greater number of samples and tags.  
Additional features, including names, book titles, and likes, will be added as well. 

Some potential tasks are:

* Classifying whether a single tag fits the quote
* Predicting several tags that fit the quote
* Creating new quotes using generative models

Hi All,

I have created my first Kaggle InClass competition. Before I throw it open to my students, I wanted your help in testing it and doing a dry run!

It's a private competition. Link to join (valid for next 24 odd hours):  
[https://www.kaggle.com/t/20256b9923464ac08efc2ce0144530f7](https://www.kaggle.com/t/20256b9923464ac08efc2ce0144530f7)

## About the competition

This is a classification competition. .

We have 568,454 rows of data, split into 455,067 train data and 113,387 test data. The test data is split approximately 50% each into the public leaderboard and the private leaderboard (or ""hold out"" dataset).

For the train data set, we have the details of

ProductId = product id

Summary = review heading

Text = review text

as well as

Rating = score by the reviewer

For the test data, the Rating field is not provided and has to be predicted by the participant.

The evaluation is based on accuracy.

The baseline scores assume all the ratings are 5.

Q: Is there a way, (maybe creating a new team or something??) we can  do to let a team member go and not be stuck with us, while also giving  the opportunity to someone who wants to contribute and can't find a team  to host him?

It is essentially creating a simple NN with a couple of layers with data from the provided dataset. I wanted to play around with the layers, dropouts, etc., however, I don't know how to train the model.

I know you have to call [model.fit](https://model.fit)(), with the xtrain, ytrain, batch\_size, and epochs. But it wasn't clear what the xtrain and ytrain parts were. He simply create a ""train"" array and says it is the input.

Just wanted to know if there was another way to train this that I don't know about or if I'm missing something. This is probably a stupid question but I wanted to see if you guys could help. thanks."

I'm new to Kaggle and looking to join a competitive team w/ (ideally non-finance) ML experts. I'm well-versed in time series ML applied to trading but interested in learning from and collaborating with a team that has a more rigorous ML and Kaggle background.

I have an MS in applied math from Columbia. I previously worked in alternative data (NLP/sentiment analysis) for trading and now currently work as a commodities/global macro mid-frequency quant (often implementing ML based models).

CPU Notebook &lt;= 5 hours run-time
GPU Notebook &lt;= 5 hours run-time
TPU Notebooks are not supported
Freely &amp; publicly available external data is allowed, including pre-trained models


Does that mean I can pre-train my own model, release it on github, say the day before, then make a submission using this pre-trained model?

That seems to align with the rules. but given the runtime is 5h, and I can pretrain a model with 5000h worth of equivalent training time, then use that it doesn't seem very fair?"

I am currently studying for a psychology bachelor's degree which includes a statistics module. In it we students have to learn how to navigate through certain datasets provided by our uni and solve certain tasks.

The tasks are usually structured as follows: *1) Please check that all variables are presented as the correct level of measurement. (e.g. changing an item from numeric into a character or ordinal scale variable)

*2) Please calculate the standard deviation/correlation coefficient/and so on... of the varibale A/ variable B.

*3) Please depict your results in a boxplot with whiskers.

Unfortunately, after having solved the single exercise provided per unit, there are no other exercises that I could go through in order to get some extra practice reps in. The subsequent exercises most often already involve more complicated functions/tasks and require us to by that time have consolidated the previously gained knowledge.

Since all of this is pretty new to me, I would feel much more confident solving the exercises of the newer units, if prior to that I had the chance to practice a little more on exercises similar to the previous kind.

My question: Could someone refer me to a website/reddit topic that provides dataset exercises for empirical science (preferably with solutions, so I can check on myself)?

I hope someone can help me out with this one.

Thank you in advance

PS:
I've posted this before in a different subreddit, but when I stumbled upon kaggle during my research, I came to the conclusion that I might have more success finding an answer in this community. Already started working with some Datasets I found on kaggle, but to my disappointment, I had chosen a rather incompatible dataset (too big), which caused R Studio to crash on my macbook after trying to create a simple 'CrossTable'. In Uni we are usually working with Datasets that revolve in the KB realm rather than the MB realm."

I’ve posted the following in the Kaggle forum, but I don’t see much traffic, so hoping someone here can help. This is related to the Kaggle “Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning” course. 

I've managed to submit the agents from the previous exercises successfully. I can also run the code in the notebook for the Deep Reinforcement Learning exercise successfully, but keep getting the error listed below when I submit the agent, and kaggle tries to run it. Where am I going wrong?

The code for my agent is as follows - I've previously executed model.save(""my_model"") and it gets submitted as an output file. I believe I've imported all the required modules???

#

def agent1(obs, config):

from random import choice
import numpy as np
from stable_baselines import PPO1

model = PPO1.load(""my_model"")
# Use the best model to select a column
col, _ = model.predict(np.array(obs['board']).reshape(6,7,1))
# Check if selected column is valid
is_valid = (obs['board'][int(col)] == 0)
# If not valid, select random move. 
if is_valid:
    return int(col)
else:
    return random.choice([col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[int(col)] == 0])
#

The next thing for you to learn should be hyper-parameter optimization. It's a powerful step to increase your model performance. Have a look at the picture attached. You may think ""It ain't much"" but actually it's a significant improvement.

I have prepared a basic notebook explaining what is hyper-parameter optimization and what techniques/algorithms are used to do it. It talks about -

* Manual Search
* Grid Search
* Random Search
* Bayesian Optimization
