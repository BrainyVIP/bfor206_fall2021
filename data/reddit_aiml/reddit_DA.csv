I am a data science student working a data analysis and visualization research project using R, Rshiny, and D3. I am a Data Science student and I am thinking of using FitBit data, which is actually quite hard to find. I have data from two friends. However, I would need more respondents for accuracy.

I am interested in gathering all the different Fitbit measures such as: 
*  steps 
*  calories 
*  distance 
*  sleep patterns 
*  weight 
*  BMI 
*  Any additional measures available 

* Any time period will be acceptable, but a longer time period would be great for trend visualizations!

As I am only interested in the health statistics, I do not need any personal information, and neither will any personal information be presented during the project. I will maintain anonymity. You can export the data, you simply need to log into Fitbit.com and click on the top right corner and select export data. The **CSV format files** can be emailed to: **fitbit.visualizationproject@gmail.com**

I would really appreciate it if I could also get some help gathering data. Please feel free to email if you have any additional questions! Thank you so very much in advance!"

But I don't want this just to be me. That means two things:

1. *What you want this subreddit to become* - **AND** - *How you think that it could best be shaped to get there.*
2. Do you want to help? *i.e. Would you like to be a moderator here to help shape this community?*

So share your ideas! There are a few other data-related subs on Reddit, so how should this one be different? What niche should it fill? 


And if you're keen to help with moderating, please make a request, either by posting below or sending me a PM. The qualifications are fairly simple: 1. Possessing an active interest in data analysis. 2. Being an active user of Reddit. 3. A willingness to be helpful and to contribute. Explain how those apply to you, and you too can be a mod here. I'm quite keen to have some fellow mods, since the other subreddit that I mod, /r/ImageJ, occupies a fairly well defined niche and is not subject to much spam.

I was wondering if you guys could help me with a problem on my homework. The question states that we are to use ANCOVA. 
I have been searching the web and have not really found a definition that helps me understand what ANCOVA is. I just know that it is related to Multiple Linear Regression and it typically uses a categorical predictor and a quantitative predictor. So far we have been learning how to dummy code categorical predictors in R along with using the lm() command to form our models. We have been coupling this with MLR and also interaction effects to determine which model is sufficient to figure out our problems.
Now on to my homework question. We are using A Modern Approach to Regression with R by Simon Sheather. We are looking at the data set HoustonChronicle.csv this can be found here on the
[data set] (http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~sheather/book/data_sets.php)

We are looking at this data using ANCOVA and determining three things:
1) An increase in the percentage of low income students is associated with an increase in the percentage of students repeating the first grade.  
2) There has been an increase in the percentage of students repeating the first grade between 1994 and 2004. 
3) Any association between the percentage of students repeating the first grade and the percentage of low income students differs between 1994 and 2005."

The data spans several years.  I would like some advise on best practise for handling the change from BST and GMT (BST = British Summer Time = GMT + 1).


The problem comes from the change between the two times essentially creating a 23 hour long day (with only 46 data points) and a 25 hour long day (with 50 data points).  I think that is important not to do the analysis entirely in GMT or BST, as this will offset the usage by 1 hour for half the year, messing up any calculations about peak demand etc, but I have no idea what to do with the extra/missing records.  Discarding them seems unreasonable, as does taking an average to fill in at the other end, but maybe that's the only option?



Any suggestions / advice / examples of what you have done with this kind of data would be brilliant.  Thank you reading, hopefully someone can help!  "

If we take this as a form of political advertising / influence (which it seemed to have had some form of effect), how can we identify that this happened, or if this is happening in the future?

From the dataset of say The_Donald we could analyse:

* Post timing on a Russian timezone vs. a US one. 
* Of course IPs would be a way, but this would also be via proxy surely, and also we do not have that data public.

In each sheet, the first column has nominal categorical data (species), followed by multiple columns of numerical data, of which the only relevant column is (amount); the amount is the number of each species present in each sample. The species data differs quantitatively and qualitatively in every sample; for instance, sample 1 could have dog (amt=9) and cat (amt=8), while sample 2 has dog (amt=7), fish (amt=6), and turtle (amt=5), and sample 3 has cat (amt=4), turtle (amt=3), penguin (amt=2), and dragon (amt=1).

Analysis/output:

I want to write a function that extracts species and amount data from an excel file with multiple sheets to construct a matrix in which each row (i?) corresponds to each unique species (order doesn't matter, but no doubles) and each column (j?) corresponds to each sample, and the value for each element in the matrix is either 0 (if the species is not present in that sample) or n (where n=amt of that species in that sample).

Larger goal:

This seems like a fairly simple problem since it is simple (although tedious) to do by hand in excel. However, in dealing with larger data sets (of more than 1000 species), it would be much more efficient/reasonable to have an automated program or function that I can just apply to a whole excel file and have it run through and return the matrix so the real data visualization and analysis can be done sans brute force prep work.

I would really appreciate for someone to point me in the right direction of how to do something like this. Part of the problem is that it requires mixing quantitative and qualitative data which causes problems. Sorry the question is a bit vague, I don't have much experience and just getting started is turning out to be a bit of a roadblock. Thanks so much in advance"

(I've also been debating going back to school. If you have advice on which masters program to choose. I'd appreciate that too. I'm debating statistics vs CS but am leaning more towards statistics right now.)

Doing a group project for my Data Science class. We have cleaned all the data to the best of our abilities but my group and I lack the statistical knowledge to do anything worthy of showing to DJ Patil, former Cheif Data Scientist under the Obama Admin. If we do something interesting we can compete with other groups to show him our project but we've hit a wall.

Any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated!

What is this data about?
Research Question
Our research question concerns the following: Are there implicit determinants of MVAs(motor vehicle accident) in the city of San Diego? In our project, we look into data regarding weather, infrastructural integrity, and the specific characteristics of the individuals involved in the accidents in question (e.g. were said individuals under the influence during the MVA).
Significance
Our research inherently deals with accidents that directly affect people in a way that is potentially harmful, not just to the infrastrucutre in San Diego, but also to the livelihood of the individuals involved in the accidents themselves. Any time there is a MVA, there is a chance that there is physical harm done, and that said physical harm may haven been partly due to the conditions surrounding the accident itself, such as potholes, poor lighting, etc. The importance we, as a group, see in this project is oriented around the possibility that doing data analysis and showing statistics on MVAs and their corresponding conditions could potentially reveal ways in which the San Diego can better prevent these accidents from occurring. For example, if we happen find a correlation between poor lighting and higher occurences of MVAs, then it may provide the initiative to investigate these areas and even potentially replace said lighting. Or if we happen to find an area of San Diego that has a high rate of MVAs while under the influence, then this could also be used to better gauge where there needs to be patrolling done to identify and prevent these forms of MVAs.

Loading and Cleaning the Data process
The main variable that we will judge whether or not a street is safe or not, is the OCI. From streets.sandiego.gov,
The 100-point OCI rating system the City [San Diego] uses classifies streets into one of three categories: Good - A street in this category has little or no cracking, minor potholes, or other distresses. It has excellent drivability and needs little maintenance or remedial repair. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between: 70 and 100.
Fair - A street in this category has moderate cracking, some minor potholes and has adequate drivability. It is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between: 40 and 69.
Poor - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, and exhibits a rough ride. It qualifies for a comprehensive repair or a total reconstruction – meaning that a street may be replaced from the ground up if conditions warrant that effort. A street in poor condition has an OCI rating between: 0 and 39.
In essence, we will be using this index to first investigate our hypothesis and find a possible correlation between street conditions [OCI] and motor vehicle accidents [Frequency]. Once we have evidence for or against our hypothesis, we can then move onto exploring other factors that contribute to MVAs.
We accomplish this by drawing OCI data and MVA collision data over a period of 5 years from the city of San Diego via their official website and combining them into a single dataframe to analyze.
We can create this single dataframe by matching an OCI with the street in which an accident occured:
Step A.
Functions that will be used to clean the data (Name of the roads, deleteting rows with specific conditions etc) In a more general matter, there are many ways to write the same thing, like an Interstate road or Street or Avenue etc .. The idea is to make it all look more or less the same to be able to handle the data better - Some cases must have been missed, mainly because of typing errors that we can't easily take into account. Cleaning the data: removing things such as highways and accidents that did not occur on a street of the offical OC. We do this to keep consistency with the datasets. Also removing any cases where the accident occur under the influence of drugs or alcohol
The second part loads the data and sends it to the cleaning function.

Creating the data frame by loading oci data csv - It is written in that way in case we would want to update the years (OCI of 2015 for example)

Merging the data : 3 functions total. We loop through the MVA_DF to find the OCI of the street where the accident occured. Sadly, the way to report a street for accidents is not the same as the OCI dataset so we had to make choices. The main idea is to match the main street name (So PRIMARY_RD in the MVA_DF with 'street' in the OCI DF. To match two strings, we first try the easy ""=="" comparison, but it rarely perfectly matches, so if it doesnt, we use the function ""difflib.get_close_matches"" with n=1 to have the closest possible match. - Once we match the main street, we might have more than more row, so we now look at the intersection which is ""SECONDARY_RD"" in the MVA_DF but is split in two for the OCI DF ('street_to', 'street_from') - The idea is to match SEC_RD to either street_to or from using == or close match but if more than one result comes out, we include it only if the oci_description (good, fair, poor) is the same. The big issue with this way of doing it is that the OCI DF doesn't take in account all street intersection and that MVA_DF is not very precise so even by us, it is difficult to figure out on which segment of the street the accident happened.
The inter function is the one figuring out the intersection match out of the main street already matched The dataframe function is to append any line that matches to our final DF by joining the information from OCI and MVA

My B.S. is a dual degree in mathematics and secondary education. 

I've been trying to figure out what exactly I want to do - all I know is I want to use math to solve problems, but I'm no math genius and I don't want to do heavy calculus/differential equations etc. I want to have the option of being able to work in a variety of industries - sustainability, health, bank, whatever. I like working with/around people and I enjoy presenting. From what I've read, I think data analysis would be a good fit for me (if you have other suggestions I might not have come across, please share!). 

I was planning on doing a M.S. in applied and computational math, which would include some courses in data science, data mining, and data visualization, along with computational statistics and statistics theory courses. However, my software engineer friend thinks the M.S. is unnecessary and that it would be much more practical, relevant, and economical to do a specialization series specifically for data analysis. 

I'm eyeing the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity. [Here is the syllabus.](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/591e18bf_dand-syllabus/dand-syllabus.pdf) I've been learning Python for a few months. As data analysts, do you think this would give me a strong foundation? Would this nanodegree be more valuable for a future data analyst than the aforementioned M.S. applied/computational math? If I do the nanodegree, what else should I do in order to be a competitive candidate for data analysis positions?

So, first I want to give you some starting info:

- 27 yrs
- Mechanical Engineer
- Likes programming, but has no knowledge/experience of it*
- Strong Analytical skills

*1 class of python in college

 

I recently moved to London and want to pivot my career to Data Analysis. But as someone with basically no prior experience and knowledge of the area, I fully understand there is going to be a lot of studying for the next couple of months. Although I do not let this get me unmotivated, I want to maximize my study time by asking you guys this question:

 


**What courses / programming languages / certificates should I go for in order to land a job as a Data Analyst in London?**

 


After doing some research I have come to this:

1. [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) on Coursera

  Why? Because it is cheap, self-paced, online and gives me a foundation.

2. An SQL Course + Certification

 Why? Because a lot of jobs require that you know SQL.

 


**What you guys think about this? Would you suggest something different?** 

 


Would love to hear from reddit! Thank you!"

i have a data set which are sales data. The dimension a b and c are specific locations and d are different users. for a metric i have a few values like the value of a transaction.

a   b   c    d    v1    v2
This shows the possible different values:
[1-10] [1-1000] [1-1000] [1-10000000] v1 v2

Now when i understand correctly and i put that kind of data into prometheus, every unique combination of a, b, c and d creates a timeseries. With all 4 metrics it would be something like 10^15 variations. Way to much for prometheus, im guessing.

Now would it be okay to use prometheus only for a, b and c?

And is there a way or a function/functionality to find the top 10 of a, b, c and d when a, b and c is defined?

Like 1, 451, 116, d results in finding top 10 d whith some aggregation function over value1 or value2.

I hope i explained it somehow understandable :)"

A chunk of onlineshop.com’s Movies &amp; Events business is driven by sales of ABC open vouchers. These vouchers - usually in the denomination of $500 - are basically coupon codes that give a flat discount on any transaction on the ABC website or app.

The system is such that the purchase of the voucher &amp; eventual booking of movie tickets happen on two different platforms with no linking between the two.

On an average, onlineshop sells 10X such vouchers in a month (and buys them in bulk from ABC @ USD X), offering an aggressive cashback of 50% on each of the vouchers. This was at one point, the highest cashback being offered on movie tickets across the industry.

However, despite such penetrative pricing, the business from ABC open voucher sales has failed to grow.

Only recently, ABC made an offer to help improve its voucher sales by giving onlineshop two alternatives:

Option - 1) After the end of every successful ABC voucher purchase, onlineshop customers will get to see a ‘Book your tickets’ button - clicking which will redirect the customer to the ABC website/app where he/she can carry on with the movie show booking process

This redirect option costs USD 5000X a year and has an upper cap of 10,000 transactions beyond which the amount has to be paid again.

Option - 2) Like on other booking platforms, ABC sells onlineshop its technology and allows for API integration to take place. As a result of this customers can purchase the voucher &amp; book their seats on the onlineshop app itself in a seamless flow. But this integration has an annual cost of USD 38000X.

As the analyst asked to optimise for the best way forward, your task is to try and answer the following questions:

(Assume X to be any suitable integer)

1) List the possible reasons why the business might not have grown as rapidly as it should have despite the kind of pricing being offered?

2) Suggest possible ways to gather evidence/data to support the reasons listed above

3) What are the alternatives that the management can pursue apart from the two options that ABC has put forward

4) In the scenario that one strategy/alternative has to be implemented from a pool of many - what is the process that is going to be used to pick the best option

My apologies if this is the wrong sub to put post. 

Anyway, as the title suggests, I am currently working as part time Admin. Assistant at a small company who wants to be a Data Analyst. 

I only work on weekends. I recently just got my Associates Degree in Engineering Science.  During my last semester, I took two programming classes which are both just introduction courses, namely C++ and MATLAB.  I understand that this courses aren't really hardcore or advanced classes but I immediately liked them. 

Currently not in school right now but will go back to continue my bachelors for Civil Engineering.( I plan on switching my major after taking a semester since I initially got accepted in this major first.) I'm planning on switching to Computer Science or Computer Engineering.  

I used to not have a clear direction on what I really want to become. Or have a real career aspiration. My usual thinking is usually just go with the flow. However, recently , after coming across an article online , I saw that Data Scientists makes good money. Digging deeper, the job sort of aligns with some of the responsibilities of a Data Analyst.  Truthfully, because of seeing this, I decided I'd try becoming one since I'm not making much from my current job and I don't ""supposedly"" need a degree to become one. 

Being pumped with this new aspiration, I started taking online classes. I am currently taking python, java , advanced excel and statistics(for review) via Udemy and LearnPythonTheHardWay. 

Is it really possible to be a Data Analyst with no bachelors and being self taught? 

One more thing to note is that I am really broke and might actually be kicked out from my place soon so I don't have the budget to attend bootcamps which are usually running from $4k to $15k, 

Kindly let me know if you have any advice. 

TLDR:  I have an Associates Degree in Engineering Science but currently working as a part time Administrative Assistant in a small company and wants to switch gears and be a Data Analyst , hopefully without having the need to finish a Bachelors Degree due to financial situation.

While trying to get my head around those, I found that they sound quite similar to what semipartial correlation coefficients in (linear) regression analyses express. Is that right? Can they even be viewed as being equivalent? Or am I misunderstanding something fundamental?

Thank you very much for any help!

Despite knowing and feeling comfortable with many advanced statistical concepts, I realized I am very weak in general descriptive and comparative quantitative analysis and, probably more importantly, in the presentation of such information. I of course know how to look at the distributions or these characteristics for a variable, but I struggle with knowing when to use tables vs. graphs and which information to even include. 

This is particularly true when comparing a sample to a population to see how representative it is, or when attempting to find trends or patterns, especially when the variables are of different types (categorical, continuous, etc.) and cross-tabulations. An example I am struggling with is, comparing participation in a program across different income categories where I am comparing the sample to the population from which it is supposedly drawn from. Is there a good resource for learning how to do this? How does one learn these skills? 

Is my mind just broken in this area or was my education lacking? I seems like what was learned in terms of descriptive statistics could easily be summarized in a table or graph and be done with, but obviously in the real world much more is required by someone who is expected to be ""quantitative"". 

I am embarrassed by my inadequacy and desperate for some guidelines, resources, or even what this is called - it seems like it's a step beyond descriptive statistics - is this ""data analysis""? Thank you in advance.

So, the variables I have are 1) the time points and 2) test score.
The hours of sleep deprivation could be of influence, instead of the shifted circadian rhythm. Therefore I want to take the hours not slept into account.
I was thinking of ANCOVA with dependent variable test score, independent variable the time point and as covariate the hours of not slept.
I am not sure if time point is really independent, as the same participants get measured each time point.
I wonder if this is correct and if there maybe are other options?"

Background on me: BS in math, chemistry minor. In a year of Americorps service right now and will be done in July. Learned how to code in Python to handle regression problems, pandas, etc. Been practicing on data sets from kaggle and pew, and also real world data from my job. 

My question is this, my past jobs have always been in educational technology, but I want my next job to be in data analysis. There have been some analytical components of my job in the past, and there will continue to be, but I've never really had the title ""Data Analyst"". It's always been a multifaceted position, where analysis is required, as well as administration, web design, etc. 

How do I write my resume so that I'm not lying, but I'm also highlighting contributions I've made for my company using data analysis techniques? Should I brush off the contributions I made that were not data related, or should I leave them in?

Also, is it worth anything to highlight personal projects on your resume, and if it is, how should you highlight them?"

I don't actually know how to program in VBA, but I'm learning along the way, so I'm just wondering if it makes sense for me to change from learning Excel VBA (which is amazingly incorporated to Excel and I can use it in any file) to Python.

The aim is mostly how to get data from input files in a bad format (that I can't directly work with using for example a Pivot table - sometimes I need to add rows or extrapolate data from other rubbish)

I understand that ontological user reports are very limited in determining the context of a case study's actions that influence their decisions/reactions in closed systems. But I also see the scope of observation extremely limited using the 'OCEAN' scale of measurement. If the subjects are not engaged in a highly constrained closed system, then the potential to initiate extensive chains of cause/effect (stimuli/reaction) is completely lost.

Why are the best of the best still creating and maintaining operational systems that initiate a logistic growth pattern of potential outcomes due to the environment's contextual inference capacity? These systems do nothing but dissuade outliers with high levels of developmental potential from engaging in the functions of the system and initiating causal/effect chains within the environment on their own or by interacting with other subjects.

Am I over-simplifying what may be an extremely complex system with plenty of room to grow and really I have no idea what I'm talking about?

I have experience in the healthcare field where I have developed some advanced excel skills, but I can’t claim to be an expert on pivot tables or VBA. I can’t imagine needing a huge time investment to understand pivot tables, although VBA will require some work.

My ultimate goal is to get a job with a minimum amount spent on education and time. I plan to keep working at my present job outside the field while building these skills. I’d like to move into a healthcare based data analytics job and then perhaps move into a business analytics job.

My effort was to compare actual job postings to the advice given here. After a month of research, I’m going to try to explain my understanding of the intimidating ""alphabet soup"" and how it all fits.

A. The most important question impacting financial and time factors is whether or not a degree is required. If so, what kind of degree? How advanced does the degree need to be? Bachelor’s, Master’s? It seems that some job postings are vague, noting the necessity of a Bachelor’s in ""a related field."" Vague. Other postings list Computer Science, Math,  Economics, or Business.

Also, would it be helpful to actually get a degree in Data Analysis specifically? I’m assuming Data Analysis is so new that degree programs are just now being assembled with the specialization.

Specifically, I have a Bachelor’s in Biology. I have Engineering Calculus I and many science classes under my belt, but I’m not so sure a recruiter with a job posting vaguely stating that a ""Bachelor’s is preferred"" is going to put my resume in the call back stack without a ""related field"" degree.

Occasionally, there do appear to be postings that don’t necessarily require a degree but rely more on experience and skills. I would think not having a degree limits your options but does not necessarily exclude you from all of the jobs.

The other option appears to be a cobbling together of various skills with ""Massive Online Course Certifications"" but without necessarily obtaining a university degree. The most broadly useful set of skills based on the reddit questions and job postings are: database manipulation (Excel, SQL), statistical programming (R), general programming (Python), and visualization (Tableau). Coursera and Udemy are noted by many. Any thoughts on which one is a better value for the money? 

A middle path might be to cobble together some skills, get a job in it for experience, and work towards a degree.

B. Excel is important as a foundational skill. I’m guessing there are a lot of people like me who think, “I’m great at Excel, so Data Analysis must be the job for me!” I’m wondering if many data analysts look at these folks like me and just roll their eyes. But hey, you have to start somewhere. Pivot tables and VBA seem really helpful to know beyond complex formulas you might devise in individual cells. Some jobs seem to want MS Access experience as well, but this seems to be less common. It certainly wouldn’t hurt taking some courses on Access for some basic understanding.

C. SQL is the ultimate foundation for data science in general and is absolutely required to succeed in the field. Based dipping my toes in and completing a beginner’s course on Khan Academy, it seems that SQL offers a variety of options in querying data that would be overly complex in excel. I was amazed at how much shorter some queries would be in comparison to an excel formula designed to do the same thing. I’m not sure about the interface one uses SQL day to day on the job, and I obviously still have a lot to learn. I was able to navigate to an SQL section in MS Access and run some queries, just not sure what interface or software you use in conjunction with SQL.

D. No one has commented on statistics in detail. Maybe that’s a given and I’m a dunce, but it seems that for someone who’s not in the field, some kind of course in statistics would be a good foundation to build from. All of the software competencies are nice, but the statistics seems to be a rudimentary requirement. If one were not going to acquire a degree in some related field, a statistics course would be important. I’m assuming that one from an accredited university would be the most helpful. With that said, the programming language R appears to be very important. I spoke to a data analyst who explained that R is an open source language and cheaper for students and businesses to use. On the other hand SAS is a language that is very expensive and used more in advanced data science. 

E. Some kind of visualization software to create charts and dashboards such as Tableau. Crystal Reports also seems fairly common.

F. Less common software skills: Hadoop, Mapreduce, SSPS, SSRS, and SSMS."

It focuses on the analysis of what 「Today」’s promotion can bring for apps and helps developers conclude the application process and requirements of 「Today」. As the coming of iOS 11, great updates have happened on Apple App Store, including new interface style, internal algorithm and other functions. Among all the updates, the newly\-born 「Today」 gains more attention. What is Apple 「Today」? How many stories have been published? How many apps have been promoted? Which app has been promoted mostly? Which developer wins the best? How about the promoting results? What happens on rankings after promotion?

AppBi, an App Search Marketing pioneer, recently has released App Store Data Report on TODAY, aiming to bring more insights for iOS developers! Firstly let’s have a glance at Apple 「Today」: 「Today」 is derived from “Feature” of iOS 10 App Store. It displays 6 cards every day \(US\) with app stories in cards written by App Store editors, introducing many apps and games for iOS users. Generally, 6 cards will be displayed every day. There is no doubt that it is the best promoting way for iOS apps. Each card has theme, title, and story and downloads link, etc. 📷 The report is based on the US 「Today」 data from 2017\-09\-09 to 2018\-02\-09 \(153 days\), including 918 stories and 2,403 apps.

「Today」 Stories

1 Themes of 「Today」 📷 GAME OF THE DAY, APP OF THE DAY and THE DAILY LIST are the top 3 themes of 「Today」. The three accounts for about 60&amp;#37; of all the themes. 1.2 Apps of Each Story 📷 It always promotes only 1 app of each story; while some may promote several apps at the same time. Generally speaking, one story with one app will lead to better results. 1.3 Times of Apps 📷 For each app, it does not has only one chance to be selected by 「Today」. If an app is really excellent or suitable for many themes, it may be promoted many times. 1.4 Best Stories of 「Today」 📷 The story listed above is written by App Store 「Today」 editors. With a narrative tone, the story leads us to a fairy tale world with weird, half\-pipe and red snapper. It arouses users’ interests to find more funning things of the app. With the vivid story, this app has ranked higher than before and acquired numerous users.

Features of 「Today」 Apps 2.1 Categories 📷 From the distribution of categories, it is concluded that Apple editors are more likely to select the apps of Games and Education. These kinds of apps have more opportunities. 2.2 Rating Stars 📷 On the basis of AppBi’s analysis, rating star may be one of the standards of Apple editors. Higher rating stars generally mean higher quality of apps. 2.3 App Price 📷 Apple sometimes may promote some paid apps so that it can also get benefits from them.

Top Apps of「Today」 3.1 Apps Promoted Mostly 📷

Only parts of apps can be promoted many times. They are the “lucky dogs” among the millions of iOS apps. 3.2 Best Apps of “Free of Top Charts” 📷

For the Free of Top Charts, the top apps averagely has raised by 1481. 3.3 Best Apps of “Paid of Top Charts” 📷

For the Paid of Top Charts, the top apps averagely has raised by 1496. 3.4 Best Apps of “Top Grossing of Top Charts” 📷

For the Top Grossing of Top Charts, the top apps averagely has raised by 1318. 4. Top Developers of「Today」 📷 📷

From the Top 10 list, we can find that, besides some qualified developers’ products, Apple will also promote its own apps. 5. Overview of Rank Changes 5.1 Changes after Promotion 📷 From the top bar chart, we can know that for the three situations of top charts, most apps rank higher than before, some rank lower and some can reach the top 1 after promotion. 5.2 Changes within 7 Days 📷 On the account of AppBi’s research, it is concluded that for any top charts, the average rank rising ranges will be smaller as time goes. 6. Surprising App —— Splitter Critters 📷 The app \[Splitter Critters\] has been promoted several times. And after each promotion, it ranks higher than before, even reaching top 10. One of the most rewarding things is that \[Splitter Critters\] has been selected by Apple as the “Best App of 2017”. 📷 7. Disappointing App —— Apps that have been promoted by 「Today」 more than once have no rises on ranking. 📷

Stickers and Health &amp; Fitness are the most disappointing categories. It means that 「Today」 has promoted apps of these categories; However, the apps have not been listed by App Store in any top charts. 8. Conclusion 8.1 Data Report This AppBi report on「Today」is based on 918 「Today」 stories and 2,403 apps. Among all the reporting details: The most frequent themes are: GAME OF THE DAY, APP OF THE DAY and THE DAILY LIST; One story may promote 1 app or 20 apps at the same time; The best story can lead to huge rising of the promoted app; Most apps are promoted by 「Today」 once only; The app \[Netflix\] has been promoted 16 times by 「Today」; Games and Education apps are mostly promoted; The selected apps mainly have 4.5 rating stars; Large number of apps’ ranking rises after promotion; Some of them even reach Top 50 or Top 10; …… The questions about 「Today」 may be solved. This is the “story” of 「Today」 and we can find many funny details or some surprising ones. AppBi hopes that the data and analysis can be useful for you. 8.2 Future Trends On the account of the AppBi’s findings, it seems that 「Today」 selects apps randomly; However, some common features of the selected apps may be picked. What are the common requirements of those promoted apps? AppBi guesses that in future, 「Today」 will take the following factors into consideration when selecting apps. High Quality Apps: An app with high quality interface and creative functions will have more opportunities to be promoted by 「Today」. Also, a high quality app means it can meet users’ certain demands. User\-friendly Interface: As we know that both Apple’s hardware products and software ones tend to keep a simplest style, so simple designing style and user\-friendly interface will catch App Store editors’ eyes. Fluent Operating Process: If an app is operated not smoothly, it may lose plenty of users due to the bugs. Fluent operating process can be a basic requirement of a high quality app. Except for the above listed ones, some extra points may also be important. For example: · Firstly\-released apps or updated apps: according to AppBi’s analysis, those apps that are firstly\-released on App Store or updated for a new version have more opportunities to be selected. · Eye\-catching stories of apps: as we know that 「Today」 will introduce an app with words, images and videos sometimes, so an app with an eye\-catching story may make itself stand out. This report made by AppBi is aimed to help more developers get the knowledge of 「Today」 and learn more about its data. AppBi believes that 「Today」 will select and introduce more high quality apps in future. And users can find their favorite apps when reading stories."

I have two sets of items that have been ranked by people according to multiple criteria (let's say personal use, beauty, usefulness) on scales from 1 to 10. I now need to pair one item from set A with one item from set B, basing this on which items have the most similar scores (means) on all the criteria.

To give a possibly better explanation, I need to take Item A1 and know which item from set B has been rated the most similarly, taking in consideration Personal use, Beauty, and Usefulness all together.  



Set A |  | Personal use | Beauty | Usefulness
-----||------------|------|----------
Item 1 |  | 2.3 | 4.6 | 2.1

I have arranged this signal into a matrix of dimension 135 by 640, representing 135 epochs (135 responses to a stimulus) with each epoch recorded over 640 samples.

I want to cluster among these epochs to try to find a centroid epoch representative of the majority of all epochs (maybe represent 3/5 of the epochs, or 81 of 135 epochs). The epochs being chosen for this largest cluster are to be chosen from the clustering algorithm, but should be in the ""middle"" of the data, such that the centroid I am looking for represents well the average activation pattern, while in a way being ""de-noised"" by epochs that are more or less outliers.

I was looking into kernel pca and how it uses a kernel to remap the data to be linearly separable, but this did not appear to work well with my epoch data in terms of separation so that the center most epochs were separated away from everyone else.

I was wondering if anyone else here uses any clustering methods for getting a large central cluster. Ideally, I want the number of clusters to be ""data driven"" (up to the data to decide), but I want the largest cluster to represent more than half of the epochs."

For starters, I interned at this place for two years as in the operations department, and have secured a position titled, ""Network Optimization Analyst."" I already know what I will be doing as I have been phased into it this past semester. 

I will get SQL access for creating custom queries after 6 months of full-time employment (long story but this was implemented only a couple weeks ago). The meat of the job is optimizing the company's shipping network, and when to use their personal fleet containers or outside fleet containers. 

For example, we run a report everyday that records a list of all shipments that day for a specific region. We use that report to identifying which shipments should be ran using our personal fleet vs outside fleet based on a variety of criteria that you folks don't need to waste your time on. That is just a quick snapshot of one simple task in the morning. 

The team has access to the entirety of the company's data warehouse, and I will to after those 6 months. Some examples are identifying problem customers regarding storage of our containers, coming up with potential solutions, and relaying those off to the customer service rep teams for those customers. 

Once I have access to SQL (I actually had access to it for several months before they instituted the new policy and I made a ton of custom queries I was interested in), the potential of the job really comes through. 

So while this technically is not a specific data analytics position, it does involve heavy SQL, Excel, and Tableau use if we wish to visualize the data. Do you guys think this is a good first step?"

I haven't completed my bachelor's yet, but I am not without education. I took an IT vocational program where I obtained a certificate of completion for the program itself. Aside from college level business communications and IT courses, the program offered specialized tracks to students. My track was the data analytics track where students studied data analytics using tools like Excel, MySQL, Tableau, and intro to Python for 6 months through a separate organization that was partnered with this IT program . After those 6 months, along with the IT certificate, I also received certification of completions for MySQL, Tableau, and Python through this separate organization. 

After the program I went on to gain an internship as an HR Data Analyst for 6 months and then a 2 month contract extension, totaling my experience to 8 months in the field. I just accepted a job offer as a finance and accounting analyst that I plan to stay on for about 6 months to bring my experience to over a year in the field.

I have more than some college education/credits, but haven't completed because of a lack of financing. This is where my question comes in. As I'm 25 nearing 26 there is a sense of urgency to get my shit completely together before I'm 30. So I'm wondering if I could succeed in the field of data analytics with the following hypothetical qualifications. Keep in mind that each scenario literally describes a path I'm considering taking, but simply don't have enough direction, experience, or knowledge to predict the best outcome. That's why I'm asking for help.

1. Associate of Science in related field with current Certs and cert's from University of San Francisco in both SQL and R programming while working

2. Current Certs and pursue Univ. of SF certs in SQL and R programming while working

3. Obtain Bachelor's in Communications (because it's one of the degrees that I can literally obtain within a year and it'll be nice to have a ""formal"" education) with current Certs and pursue univ. of SF certs in aforementioned fields

4. (Most time consuming and expensive option, least favorite) Work and save up to put myself through college and obtain a B.S. in Statistics

I would honestly prefer 1 or 3, but I need to know if I would have a good chance of being hired or considered with those certain qualifications. Would I be ""set"" and good? Also, please keep in mind my work experience in the field. I literally don't know what to do and can't make any moves towards anything without being well informed. Any insight, advice, and or general guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

My expectations for my final result would be, more or less, a summary of the following: total hours spent doing ""X"", total money spent, average time spent doing ""X"" each day, average amount of money spent each day, total of steps taken, miles walked, biked, etc. I have collected all of the data by using apps and I can export it out, be it with a .csv or Excel file, except for the tracking data, which I can only get via Google's Takeout service and I have no idea how to use effectively.

I would like to know if any of you might know a way to divide the regional set of data in order to have them match the sub-regional one ?

The data are about goods and were obtained through two different sources, I would like to compare them to see if there are any discrepancies.

Thank you very much for your ideas :)"

Do I need to rescale my variables (my variables are calculated using the mean of the individual questions per questionnaire) before running a linear regression analysis? 

If so, what would be the best way? 

Also, do I understand correctly that if the VIF is under 10 I don’t need to mean center the variable?

My model looks like this:

DV: Guilt employee OR Shame OR Anger
1. Age (control)
    Seniority (control)
    Dummy var 1 for job type (total of 4 job types) (control)
    Dummy var 2 job type (control)
    Dummy var 3 job type (control)
2. Error management at employee workplace OR Error aversion (IV)

- All VIF scores are under 1.5 
- Error management is only significantly correlated with guilt and error aversion
- Error aversion is significantly correlated with age, shame, anger and error management
- In some analyses the IV has a significance under .05 (so I was thinking that the variable would be important for the model)

Does anyone know what the problem can be? My entire thesis research is based on these analyses and I have no idea why this is happening or what I can do next.

So the basic background behind this analysis is that in order to be a block producer for EOS, you need to be voted by EOS token holders into the top 21 positions. Within these token holders are ""whales,"" which hold an ungodly amount of EOS tokens, and thus have a lot of voting power. I am trying to do analysis on how each whale's voting trends change with the release of block producer activity (or how they don't, which might signal a significantly biased voter). Activity can vary between creating decentralized apps for the community, tools for the community to use, etc. I'm pretty new to this (just an intern), and was wondering how I could create a meaningful dataset on it! 

Here is the information I will basically be using, it includes block producers and who voted for them at the present time (I can't find historical voting data atm, so I'll probably be collecting data every MWF, as this is when I work):  

[https://voters.eostitan.com/voters/50/0/21](https://voters.eostitan.com/voters/50/0/21)

I was thinking about creating a longitudinal data set for each whale, with dummy variables used for votes on the block producer candidates that they voted for at each time period. However, I'm not sure where to go from here. The important information is when/if their votes change, and matching that to some sort of news release. This would signify what the whale voter values in a block producer.  

Any insight would be highly appreciated! Thank you! "

Below I have attached a link to what I have been working on. So far I have only done surface level analysis of the stats, basically whatever category is higher among the three of us gets more points afforded to them, and then at the end those points are added up to rank us all. 

Not sure if this is the most effective way to do this ranking, and I would love some suggestions if you guys have any opinions on how to properly rank all of us. I started attempting to compare all of us, but I am stuck on how I fairly judge and weigh each category for each player since we all have very different amounts of time put into the game. I don't know if there is some sort of conversion that I could or a formula to implement to compare us. Also the fact that one of my friends has never even played ranked in the game throws off all of the stats in the Secure Area, Bomb, and Hostage Category.

I would really appreciate if anyone has the time to read this. I am at a crossroads in my life where I just want to finally make something out of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am closing in on 26 years old, having previously dropped out of an engineering degree at one of the most difficult/prestigious universities due to the heavy workload of mathematics + physics and programming. I simply was not cut out for the pace and it mentally exhausted me. Instead I ended up becoming a Dental Hygienist as I always had the desire to help people. Unfortunately I am now missing the role of IT and the dream of having a desk-job so to speak.

I am unsure regarding the terms of Data/Digital/Webb Analytics so I hope you guys can help me out there.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been searching for a new path that would offer something less strenuous whilst still being in a similar field as my original goal. There is a program that is 1.5 years long and will ""eventually"" allow me to work as a Digital Analytic or Webb Analytic. There does seem to be a good future prospect in terms of work availability and the salary also seems rather strong.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is mostly: Is it a difficult subject/path? Can anyone accomplish it with some moderate hard work?  
I was never super strong in mathematics and the likes. Programming was fun but only up to a point.  
Physics broke me entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that a career in Programming is for people who almost have an innate ability and passion to do that on their spare time as the competition of other coders is rather enormous.

I want something that is a little bit... less demanding, yet still allows me to contribute and be in a similar field.  
Working with already existing software and analyzing data to draw conclusions and aid a company in its endeavors is very interesting to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I might also add that I created a gaming community at the age of 12 which has now existed for almost 15 years.  
I spent a lot of time setting up a website, forums, trying different tactics to market ourselves and analyzing periods where we got the most growth. Today we are a little over 100 members and I feel this career path can almost tie into my leadership hobby so to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this career opportunity is calling to me in a sense. But I have little to go on in terms of what the career itself means outside of googling around. And I have to admit I am a bit scared of not being enough ever since dropping out of engineering university...

What do you guys think? I realize its hard to make such an assessment  when you do not really know me. But do you need any real -innate- gifts to turn this into a career?  I appreciate any responses, thank you."

I’m a 22 year old business student who will be graduating following the upcoming spring semester. For most of my life, I’ve known two things about myself: I’m passionate about 1) sports and 2) the analytics surrounding it. 

Sports analytics has grown tremendously in the recent years, as professional teams are beginning to implement full departments dedicated to it. And now for the first time, I think I’ve found something I want to pursue. Obviously getting a chance with a professional team would be extremely difficult, but this is an area that I’m sure will grow on every level.

My degree will not be in data analytics, but instead I’ll have a general business degree with a track in economic development. 

I plan on putting together multiple side projects related to sports analytics, and hopefully they will be on a high enough level to mention them on my resumé. My question is this: what other steps would be beneficial for me if I pursue this path? Basically I’m just worried that my major will hurt me in chasing this.

I work in healthcare and I'm preparing a presentation about biomarkers. As a part of it I want to plot how some substances increase and decrease during the disease time (I work with R / R studio). Part of the job is done with density plots, that work great for a single substance, but are messy for comparing many of them.

&amp;#x200B;

In some places (e.g. books) I've seen a kind of plot that I like. I have time in the X axis, and on the Y axis every substance. An horizontal bar starts at the time the marker appears and ends when the substance disappears. Some advanced plots also show segments in different colors to show times where the substance might or might not be present, and a dot to show the maximum.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this kind of plots have a name, and if I knew it it'd be easy to find a way/package to make them. I've tried looking for chronograms and bar plots, but I couldn't find any design close to what I'm looking for.

I build marketing reports for a small e-commerce company that is continually growing. I'm trying to transition from report builder to more of a data analyst position. There no one else at the company that does this kind of work so there isn't someone I can learn this from. 

The company itself is in the early stages of it's data maturity. 

We don't have a database.

I manually enter data from different sources (Google Ads, Goolge Analytics, Facebook, Amazon, Shopify, etc.) into an Excel sheet and use Power BI to visualize the data (I do this on a weekly and monthly basis). I don't mind making reports this way but I know there are better ways to go about this.

I think the best way for me to transition to a data analyst position would be if I could improve my work-flow so I can focus on other projects other than just building ad-hoc reports all day. 

Do I need a database to do this?

If you were in my position what are some steps you would take to build/grow the data department or lack thereof?

The goal is to prioritize which pages we should work on our website to increase visibility through SEO strategies.

I have four data points I’m working with: Impressions, Average Position, Clicks, and First Touch Revenue (from all marketing channels - basically to get an idea which pages convert).

I could just filter through the data in excel, starting with the pages that already drive the most revenue - pull that list, then those with top positions - pull that list, then top clicks -etc. , then top impressions - etc - but I’d like to have a way to consider each data point at the same time and prioritize that way.

I could do a scatter plot, x axis is impressions, y axis is average position, and the size of each point is based on revenue - but this might get tiresome working with 200+ pages.

I’m curious how anyone else might look at this dataset and evaluate these 4 data points.

I’m up for any suggestions related to excel/google sheets, or python or PowerBI ( I have some familiarity with these)

I'm a Maths student in my 2nd year of University and I'm considering following a career path in Data Analysis.

I enjoy Statistics, programming (especially in Python) and I have some experience with Graphic Communication.

Statistics is my favourite module from my maths course. It amazes me how reliable it can be to the real world.

I have some experience with coding in Python. In particular, I enjoy creating functions that automatise dull processes.

I also have an interest in Machine Learning and I am aware of how statistical modelling is linked to it.

I studied Graphic Design/Communication for 3 years. From this I learned how to present a product to costumers. I also had a project in info graphics, what I believe is highly linked to the Data Visualisation side of Data Analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of this out of the way, do you think Data Analysis is for me? And more importantly, what area of Data Analysis do you think will be best suited for me?

Looks like some guy went around black neighborhoods, gathered absentee ballots, and threw them out. 

If you look at the numbers for the elections this guy worked on, the fraud is [blatantly obvious](https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1070111027268866051?s=09) to the human eye. But I figure you should be able to pretty easily detect anomalies by comparing a precinct's absentee results to their in-person results and then running them through some kind of analysis (the specific differences between analyses has left me). I figure something like this fraud would pop out with a p-value of .005 or lower.

Anyone want to give this a shot with precinct-level datasets from 2018? Or know someone who would be interested in tackling it? If this analysis found more cases of fraud it would probably make a big splash."

The specialisation contains many courses, I completed the Relational Algebra course, and then the SQL one. My main goal was to learn the basics of SQL.

After completing the Stanford course, I know a fair bit about basic querying in SQL(thanks to the large amount of practice problems the course provides) but that's about it. Not much about creating tables, just a little bit about indexing.

About me : I am a Computer Science graduate(2018) who wants to be a data engineer in the future, currently I am not looking for specifically data engineer jobs, but any data related jobs that will get me started.

I want to up my knowledge on SQL, and there are just so many pathways and courses on the web it is really overwhelming. Will love to know from the community what should I do next to learn and practice more and more SQL?

Few options that come to my mind are :

1. Complete the full Stanford database course(because I have only done Relational Algebra and SQL)
2. A SQL related project.
3. SQL challenges on Leetcode or other websites.
4. A new course related to SQL that contains as much practicing SQL as this Stanford course had (would love to know such course)
5. Something else.

However have rarely had to go beyond regression. 

I recently came across a problem where we are trying to find which among 15 categorical variables has the strongest association with a different categorical variable. My response to this was to do a T-Test with each of the independent variable and find the one with the lowest P-Value. 

Does this make sense at all? This seems to be the very definition of P-Hacking. 

Any suggestions as to more reliable ways of drawing insights from the data other than exhaustive search for relationships?"

I also do this a lot at home and for my hobby, too (PC gaming, i.e., game wikis).  


Data analysts are often tasked with taking information in rough form and making it look more cogent. It's a combination of figuring out what really matters, and then presenting it in ways that make sense (and look pretty).  


My bosses hate the word ""massage"". I guess it sounds slimy, lol. But it's the shortest phrase my brain turns to... refining data into something comfortable. Call me linguistically challenged.  


I could always say ""data mining"", but that seems too inadequate.   


A third of data analysis is seeing what matters in the raw data (mining), another third is boiling it down to what really matters (cogent), and the final third is making it presentable (simple) to folks who don't understand the data (and don't want to know details).   


It's mining plus distilling plus prettifying.  


What word or phrase do you use?

I'm a recent new-hire and the only data analyst at a decent-sized online company ($32M yearly sales). I have a couple years experience as a data analyst, so I essentially just wanted to get some feedback at the places that you guys work at.

At my company, we have no formal DBAs. We have our network administrator to monitor all of our servers, one of the web programmers wrote enough SSIS packages to get by, and another web programmer created a local site for reporting in Cold Fusion. Our e-commerce system runs on COBOL and Cold Fusion code. The data that I'm working with is an absolute mess. I just learned today that our ""ShipDate"" field isn't actually the date an order shipped...it's the date the last time that the order was changed/updated.

The CEO and Owners want me to do predictive analysis off of a spreadsheet from a third-party company that cleaned our data and added additional customer information, department managers need me to build SSRS reports and Power BI dashboards so that they can do their jobs, and our Inventory Manager does everything in Excel. I had to help her install Firefox the other day.

I understand that I'm ranting a bit. I'm sorry. The last company that I worked was not like this at all. Granted they were a much larger company, but it seems like everyone there had their shit together. Am I wrong to feel overwhelmed? Please tell me if I'm whining and if I need to just buckle down and work harder. There's a million things that I want to do to help this company. I want to sort out as many problems as I can, but I feel like I'm swimming upstream. Any advice? Has anyone been in a similar situation before?"

I recently graduated from University and started my first job regarding Data Systems (in various forms). As someone who is constantly striving for more, I'm not really satisfied with my job right now. That's the reason I decided to register at a scientific conference regarding digital economy.

For that, I need to prepare a 9-15 page long paper. I've chosen Business Intelligence for managing data and better decision making. I'll write about BI in general, Data Visualization, Information Design, companies that are data rich but not insights driven, etc.

The one part that I'm concerned about is the actual use of BI in a company environment. I plan on getting raw data from a company/companies and try to find interesting patterns for them (and include it into my paper). I live in a third world country so it will be a difficult task for me. For example, I could use a small source of data from one company and combine it with public accessible data or something like that.

I was wondering, does someone of you guys has a suggestion for me regarding this, or an example? I would deeply appreciate your feedback.

Thanks so much!!!"

Based on the audience, we may discuss a bit about modelling, but presently I do not plan to include it in our training.

Interested and In Mumbai, kindly personal message me.

We get sales reports every week and often we need to look in these sales reports to see how some events did. We currently use spreadsheets and sift through the information this way but this is taking too long, is inefficient, and doesnt give us a true idea of how events do contextually. These events occur often and I need to see all the associated information on the line associated with the event.

Basically all im looking for is a way to import spreadsheets into some sort of database that will let me search it easily. 

I want to be able to type in a search bar and be able to pull up every occurrence of an event and its associated information. 

We have certain groups we buy inventory for so I want to be able to organize the information by ways like profit and loss by certain groups etc. Would really appreciate any suggestions as I am really new to this."

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to provide a daily and monthly summary of this ratio as well. Do I sum the raw data for A and B individually for a month, and then take the ratio (n = number of A values) ? Or, should I average the hourly density values for a month (n=31\*24 for the average)? The former seems more correct, but the latter seems like it will summarize the specific value we are interested in (that is, the value of the ratio) better.

It's probably irrelevant, but 4 minutes of raw A data are correlated with a single B data point. This is why in the former average, n = number of A values.

I'm trying to use either Orange, KNIME or RapidMiner to build models for predicting sales volumes with seasonality.  I can't find any clear instructions anywhere.  I'm new to these programs and not tied to them in any way so  if there is an easier option out there I'm open to recommendations.  I'd be open to learning R if that would be best, but I though the GUI would make things easier.

The best I've managed is to get values using ARIMA in Orange but I can't get seasonality applied, so on a graph its just a straight line forecast (even though I've used the seasonal adjustment widget).  At the moment I can do a better forecast with FORECAST.ETS in excel but my plan was to use a few different models using the software and either pick the best or average them.

I have data from 2014 on and what I would really like to do is predict the sales volumes for each product type by each salesman, if that's possible.

Can anyone point me in the right direction or offer any advice?

\-The total number/frequency of certain recurring terms

\-Correlation among terms, even though they are not spelled out in the exact same way - e.g. Financial institution vs Finance Institution.

Given that Temperature and Rainfall are continuous variables just giving the daily reading of each, Site is a two-level factor giving two sampling locations and Complexity is a two-level factor denoting vegetative composition as Simple or Complex... 

I take it this means that higher temperatures and higher rainfall values have a significantly negative effect on abundance?  
If that's right, how do I interpret the Complexity and Site results, since they are factors and not continuous variables?

Apparently it went better than I thought, since despite the director that I interviewed with saying she wouldn't be done with phone interviews till next week, I got a call yesterday to set up an onsite interview ""to ensure fit"".  When she sent me the e-mail confirming the details it had a list of who I would be meeting with and what time. Some were to be expected, the Clinical Research Director, two of the Clinical Managers, but they are also having me meet with the Financial Operations Manager and the Regulatory Supervisor. I'll be spending 30-45 minutes with each one individually. 

This is my first time where I will be interviewing with people outside of the department I am being considered for, so I am somewhat unsure how to prepare for the day. The job description is somewhat vague, probably due to the fact it is a brand new position, and it sounds like there aren't many people who even know exactly what data they have to work with (the director mentioned some transition occurring including a change to a new trial management program).  So part of the new position would involve becoming familiar with the data they have and what could be done with it, how to improve efficiency etc.

My question is, how do you prepare for onsite interviews looking to assess fit, when you are meeting with people from multiple departments (especially when you aren't entirely sure how exactly you would be working with them)? Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated."

I've identified that I need to work through quite a lot of technical upskilling to make my steps into Data Analytics and I'm hoping for some feedback on my plan right now:

- I'm spending some time cementing my Excel knowledge, working with pivots, formulas and starting to learn VBA (the reason I'm starting with this is I can put these into practice in my current role and keep them fresh in my mind.)
- Next I'm planning on running through an SQL course in Udemy which should give me the basics
- I'd like to run through and get the Google Analytics certification at this stage.
- I've done a basic workshop in Python and will be focusing running through the Python institute self study courses before getting their certificate.
- Meanwhile I'm trying to create more reports in my department and be sure to start gathering them into a portfolio of what I can do.

Does this seem reasonable? Am I missing any ridiculously obvious steps or am I expanding my focus too much?  I understand that Google Analytics for example is more marketing based than what I'd probably want to pursue for a career.

Also, two more questions:

-General Assembly has a data analysis course local to me, obviously at a cost. How much would that be beneficial considering my non mathematical background? Would I be better off looking at a master's degree for which I can get government funding assistance?
- I understand I can play around on Kaggle to be able to extrapolate from data, but is there anywhere I can practice SQL ?


Thank you for your time and insights!"

I studied marketing and management information systems. My technical skills include R, SQL, custom site tagging using HTML, and viz software (tableau, powerBI). My soft skills include problem solving, teaching, time management, and working under high stress. 

I started in engineering, but switched to marketing/MIS because I enjoyed data and saw a need for old fashioned marketers to embrace the “proof” and adopt new ways to reach a more qualified audience. 

Now my work is in an agency setting. While I enjoy my clients, and the people I work with, I am quite literally the subject matter expert — but with my age, my opinion isn’t supported or respected even with data to back me up. The sheer volume of the work I pump out has left a terrible taste about data in my mouth. I’m feeling a bit lost because I’ve worked so hard to only be told that I didn’t accomplish enough in the past year, despite me building every data/modeling process from start to finish and consistently training/teaching new employees and QAing all work after it’s been completed. My role to my managers is still that of an entry level, my role to the new hires is a manager. 

There is no “structure” to my role, no known next steps to get to that “senior” or “manager” title. I have no career trajectory plan other than,  go figure it out. Typically I can figure it out, but I have no one in my personal network that has been where I am now. 

What lies ahead is a fork in the road. Either gain more technical skills to go into a data science role, or forego everything I’ve learned and built over the past year and start from scratch.

Of those who are active customers of the three paid subscriptions, how do determine most likely to cancel, continue, and responds positive to an up-sell.** 

* Answer: Segment the customers who fall into each of these categories from the past and understand some behaviors about the customer. Look at time on the website, where they spent most of the time, least time, how often did they login, did they fill out profiles, etc.. 

**Question 3:
How do we validate that the price points that we offer now are the best price points to offer to our customers?**

* Answer:  We would do an A/B test and test different price points on a small scale to see the conversion rate and then continue to work to build out the sample if price points proved more positive."

678,2019-05-16 09:33:59,1557988439.0,dataanalysis,I had my first interview for a data analyst position which involved an Excel Test and KPI(?),bp94ow,imaginingme,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/bp94ow/i_had_my_first_interview_for_a_data_analyst/,3.0,1.0,0.0,3673.0,"First of all, I graduated from a top tier public school with a degree in Statistics. Coursework primarily focused on data cleaning, analysis (from basic stats to regression/classification models) and machine learning (random forest, etc) using R. I took one course in Python which I used for a research study (no publication) and actively learning SQL and Tableau on the side. I had one short internship doing basic data entry using Excel and one research position (unpaid) using Python. Other than that, I have no relevant professional experience.

So I walk in today, the CEO says he likes my resume (probably because of my research, school, GPA, and projects) and shows me a business KPI excel sheet asks me if it's something I can make in Excel. I told him I've never made or seen/heard a KPI before but if I was given the right training and resources it wouldn't be a hard thing to do, actually, it looks pretty easy. He asked if I can do PivotTables, VLOOKUP, and SUMIF. I said yes.

Then I took an Excel test which I completed in about 40 minutes but had trouble with about 3/15 tasks. I asked beforehand if I can Google some functions in case I was stuck but wasn't allowed. 

1. I couldn't write a function that categorized four given female names into females and the rest to males, and did it semi-manually (manually sorted the names and assigned Female. Then sorted the blanks and autofill Male). 
2. I couldn't split a date+time column into two (used left function and right function but didn't work when one digit started to change to two digits). 
3. Couldn't format a telephone number column into the same  format (some values had a bunch of letters in between, some with parenthesis, some with hyphens, etc), I used the find/replace and tried to manually erase all those special keys but couldn't perfectly get rid of all those letters and special characters. 

For some reason, he said he liked me and still wanted me to come in for a second interview since I did well on PivotTables, VLOOKUP and just didn't know the appropriate functions for three problems. Next time I come in, they're going to teach me some functions and test if I can learn it quickly and successfully use it on the spot. As soon as I came home, I studied how to solve those three problems and they were very easy (IF within IF, Text to Column which I used previously but totally forgot) except for the phone number problem which required a crazy formula to extract only numbers from a string.

At this point, I’m not sure if KPIs are something I can learn in a few weeks since I was not a business/finance major. So I wanted to ask if KPI excel sheets are easy to make? Are KPIs easy to understand? Is it normal for a data analyst to make KPI excel sheets? Is this more of a Financial Analyst position? Should I take this job even though it only uses Excel (no R, Python, SQL)? It definitely wasn’t something that I expected."

Recently, I’ve been hired as an intern as data analyst and I’ve got to come up with an etl pipeline from scratch in my very first project. I know it seems like a tall order for such a newbie, but I’m determined to do it anyway.

My main concerns are about the transformation part. We have some CSV files and some other JSON (not really important tbh). Mostly, the data is standardised as usual (client ID, name, etc). I just don’t know what to do there or what to expect, to finally move it to Redshift and connect that to powerBI for business intelligence.

What should I do? What should I expect from transformation?

I’m sorry if the questions sound too stupid, I’m literally taking my first steps into the world of data and I can’t get me head around this.

I'm working on a new project right now where I'm supposed to ID a baseline of missed opportunity, based on data points from 4 weeks of orders.

For example, if a vendor placed orders for 3 items as follows, I'm supposed to ID, in theory, what they supposedly really wanted. I'm having a tough time understanding it really, and my resources here are limited at this point.

|Item|Week 1 Ordered|Week 1 Cancelled|Week 2 Ordered|Week 2 Cancelled|Week 3 ordered|Week 3 cancelled|Week 4 Ordered|Week 4 cancelled|

|3|530|530|740|470|150|150|290|290|

The idea being that they didn't really want 4,859 units for item 1, because it's using compound math (we didn't deliver any in week 1, so the demand is still there). So in theory, I need to say ""what they really wanted for item 1 for this month was X.

In a few months me and my family will be uprooting our lives and moving to another state (from Mass to Florida). Currently I work for a small asset management firm in the operations side of things. The job is great but since I'm moving, I'd like to take this opportunity to transition into a career more analytics focused. 

 I have a bachelor's in economics (recieved in 2016) and have self-learned the basics of python (data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, etc also enough to build web scrapers and extract data) and SQL (syntax, basic statements, GROUP BY, Joins, creating, deleting, editing tables/databases, and basic db design). Currently I'm brushing up on basic statistics. 


My question for this sub is, what are the minimum requirements to break into a data analyst role? Is the above enough? 

I know building a portfolio with some projects will go a long way but I'm afraid I haven't yet built a solid statistical foundation to do anything outside of descriptive statistical analysis. Is this even enough for a project or is including inferential analysis a must?

Any advise would be much appreciated!"

I always like to err on the side of being overprepared, so here's my gameplan:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Study python, learn about scraping data and visualizing it and the like. I'm a week on this and seeing some pretty good progress. Might as well begin with the hardest part out the way, especially since I need a cursory understanding of it to go into:
2. Does anyone have any thoughts on the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree? (link: [https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)) I've searched extensively for some sort of course that will give me projects and some guidance and so far this one seems like a good choice, as I'll walk out of it with a portfolio and ready to expand and add some more stuff into it. Udacity has received some flack recently and they've laid off staff and IDK so, would love some advice. 
3. Do a couple freelance projects. Maybe set up a blog to talk about the findings in detail which can help showcase my storytelling aspects as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I'm thinking I should be ready for an entry-level position in about three months of doing this full-time (remember, I'm unemployed). Is this realistic? How competitive is the job market? I'm 27 and in NYC, if it matters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated!"

I'm currently working as a data analyst for a semiconductor company and considering this is my first professional venture after receiving my degree, I was hoping for some pointers or guidance on the kinds of analysis I could do for certain subjects such as worker productivity/efficiency (this would be based on run time/work order, average pins/hr). Assuming I have the data, would six sigma analysis be appropriate or a certain form of regression? In the future, I am to also look over customer sales/revenue vs cogs/labor to determine if we're making money or rather, potential earnings/losses to see if we want to continue with such clients (ANOVA?). I was thinking of pareto analysis to figure out where the majority of the errors occur or precisely what step of the production process we could improve on. Regarding quality control, maybe binary regression since results would be pass/fail? Lastly, the ultimate goal is to create a business model that considers all factors revenue, labor, material cost etc. to figure out competitive pricing, potential profit (kind of like supply and demand curve, although my economics is a little weak). Only reason I ask is because our company is fairly new and I am to set a groundwork for future data analysis. I kind of have a general idea, but any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I know how to run analysis via various programs, it's just knowing which one to do and for the economics side, which model. Feel free to ask for more details as well and I'll do my best to provide.

I’m currently working on my undergraduate degree in physic’s, where I have about two years left before I graduate. As I have been getting more and more involved in my research, I’ve found that I REALLY enjoy the data analysis aspect of my experiments. I enjoy using both Excel and Python to arrange data and make plots and graphs and other images to represent the data. 

This revelation is making me interested in a career in data analysis. However, I’m not sure if this is just wishful thinking or i actually have a chance at this. While I imagine a degree in data analysis is the best option, but would a degree in physics necessarily hold me back from this path?"

My primary tools are Jupyter NB/Python, Tableau and Excel for when I need to give someone a list of things to target among our staff.  

We are on Office 365 and I am on multiple teams and shaprepoint team sites. The other data analysts are all in different departments, we don't share an office. We don't like that, but that's the situation. 

Back to projects, I am basically creating a project folder for each task, and have been dumping any resources needed into that folder.  Terrible idea because I'm duplicating data sets now, I realize.  I'm cleaning it up now. 

Does this describe anyone else here?  Can anyone offer advice on how to efficiently stay organized?  

I think I'll keep my project folder stuff, but move my data into a data folder and point to it in Jupyter from now on, and only put one-off resources that pertains to just that project.

What is a typical day/week like in this profession? 

How long do you think it would take to retrain to transition into an entry level data analytics role -6 mo/1yr? 

Should I work another job while training? 

Would you recommend someone who is switching careers to consider a data analysis boot camp? Which ones would you recommend?

Looking for feedback on how the more skilled Data Analysts track and manage their request backlogs.  


In brief:   


I constantly struggle with anxiety over whether I'm working productively on something important.   


My educational background is Mechanical Engineering, but I tumbled into a Data Analyst role in Financial Services upon graduating. Was one of those ""skilled test takers who could afford to be sloppy with project assignments and project management"". Cramming work into the last minute, etc.  


So now, I'm not a super skilled analyst - but I do have a strong mastery of the basics and am very keen on well crafted SQL queries, tracing data to it's source, general problem solving skills, etc. Tend to find data engineering more tangible and appealing than quantitative analysis, but mainly because my stats knowledge feels so limited so analysis to me always feels like making bar charts and then crafting some bullshit around why one is higher or lower.   


But I don't feel like I know enough computer science to be a good data engineer, and   
don't know enough stats to be a good quantitative analyst, so I tend towards debugging and optimization tasks -- looking at existing structures and exploring how their either broken or could work better.  


Advice on how to be a more skilled quant is very welcome, but even more immediately, I just constantly feel like I'm drowning in requests I either don't know how to fulfill, or focused on infrastructure concerns that have merit aren't as valued by clients/partners.  


If I don't have a backlog/request tracker, I feel less productive and focused. But with a backlog, I feel regularly overwhelmed by deadlines I don't know how to hit and projects I don't know where to start. Once my manager intervenes and provides some framework, it's usually easy for me to follow-through.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently using a Google Sheets spreadsheet to track line item requests with a few key fields like   
\- ""key stakeholder(s)""   
\- ""project deadline""  
\- ""next milestone/objective""  
\- ""next deadline""  
\- ""status"" (on track, at risk, on hold)  


But it feels like a clunky tool that takes a decent amount of time to keep current.  


Sorry if this isn't the most structured post or request for advice. I'm not very well practiced reaching out for general career skills development advice.   


Really eager to hear if other Analysts can relate to the sense of being overwhelmed by request management, and what tools and techniques they've put in place to help keep it under control."

I am currently working on a project for a soccer team at the collegiate level. My aim is to build a program that can help obtain data in-game for post match analyzing. Currently, with teams not having large budgets, the only stats that are taken are simply things such as shots, passes, crosses, etc. I want to be able to analyze different data points and optimize player and team performance based on a more specific set of statistics. Organizations such as Opta use camera and player tracking technology to gain millions of data points a game, but with a small budget, teams can't obtain big data like this and need to figure out what is important to track. I have built a c++ program to help track specific player stats in game.

It’s been almost three years since I started my education in this field and I’ve used both Python and R, but I’ve become torn between which of those languages I should be putting my hours into. 

I had a decent amount of Python experience before I even got started with data analysis so it came more naturally. Also, most of the classes and resources I’ve used lean toward using Python. However, R seems to make much more sense to me in terms of the speed and ease with which you can come up with complex visualizations (ggplot2). Data manipulation is also much simpler and quicker using the dplyr package. I love Python and use it all the time to help me automate tasks, and to connect to and update SQL databases. When it comes to data analysis though, I seem to have trouble justifying using it over R. Also, I've been watching David Robinson's Tidy Tuesday video casts, and it's really impressive to see what a professional can do with R Studio exploring a new dataset.

I know this should just be a matter of taste, and I should just go with whatever feels right to me, but everywhere I look it seems that people are saying that Python is the thing to focus on and that that is the future of this field. 

I guess I’m just hoping to hear from someone who has used both professionally, and who can offer me a bit of insight as to what might be a good direction. Thanks for your help!"

Is it really possible to self teach your way into a data science job?

Are Bootcamps worth the money?

Can I teach myself and land a job within a year?"

Javascript in a data analysis job was unusual but not unheard of, I suppose. Or is there some situation where it would be actually better than the alternative programs.

They’ve provided me a data file and want me to analyze it and present to some important people, and I assume if it goes well I’ll get the position. 

They are aware that I don’t do this on a daily basis, so I may not have the strongest background or knowledge. They also know I finish my degree soon and am still keen on learning (DOMO is first on my plate if I transition).

I’m just looking for some thoughts on what I should look to say during the presentation. Nothing to fake my knowledge or skills, but what would a data analyst say to a VP, director, 3 senior managers, and 4 peers about the data they’ve given me? I fear I’ll analyze the data and be too basic for them, and don’t want to do that. I want to give them the answers they would want to hear, not for the position, but to help them make decisions. 

The data is records of how marketing won/lost sales opportunities and where those leads originated from, as well as some minor other fields. 

Any ideas or insight for my presentation would be great. They are big on “telling a story”, but what does that mean? What story are they wanting to hear? I’m combing through the data to understand better this week. Thanks! Appreciate any insight!"

Without disclosing too much personal information, I have this internship where I am monitoring migratory populations of a certain species. The organization I'm working with has collected over 30 years of data that need to be analyzed. While browsing the data, I noticed there seemed to be a correlation between the sex distribution of this species and how far along in the migratory season it is. Basically, there seems to be a far greater percentage of males in the beginning of the season and a far greater percentage of females later in the season. By the end of the season, the sex ratios seem to even out. 

This phenomenon has been fairly consistent from year to year. However, it doesn't seem to have been mentioned much in scientific literature. I would love to further delve into this apparent phenomenon by trying to see if it is statistically significant.

So how can I combine 30 years of data, and how can I determine if the time of year corresponds to different sex ratios?

TLDR: I am a Senior Data Analyst making $95K but only have a Communications degree. Is it going to be hard if I want to move companies or should I get certifications or go back to school? 



**History:**

Graduated into the recession (2008) with a Communications Degree, hated school, didn’t know what I wanted and my cousin who was a lawyer had that degree so why not?

After 9 months looking for work I ended up taking a Lynda course on Excel, long some work experience at a bank in college, and got an entry level job in a risk department for a financial company doing lowest end work for $30K. 

Work was super manual and annoying so I read up on SQL, Excel Macros, Business Statistics etc... Used this to get higher internally at work to the point that I became the lead analyst for a large account. 

Worked there for 7 years then moved to a new company but didn’t have to interview because one of my former bosses was VP and knew I could do the job. Currently making $95K working with Tableau, sql, Python, and dabbling in Hadoop. 

**Situation:**

Currently I work with the above company but I got this job and all my promotions from knowing people. They knew my work, knew I was a hard worker and saw my results. 

I’m worried that in the future if I want to go to a new company or start applying around it’s going to be hard for me. Even now people get this puzzled look or get surprised when they find out my degree and what I do. 


**Question:**

Is this a real thing to be worried about or am I suffering imposter syndrome? If it is something to worry about what are some cheaper ways than going back to school and racking up debt to look good on a resume? Basically is 10 years experience good enough?"

Hoping some of you in here can help guide me in the right direction (including directing me to a different sub, if necessary). 

I’m currently working on a project, in which I am analyzing user-to-user notes on my company’s platform (disclaimer: this isn’t as creepy/“big brother” as it sounds...we’re looking specifically to target bad actors).

My goal is to identify the most common words used in these specific notes. I am analyzing about 5,600 notes in total. 

Currently, I have each note housed on a separate row within Excel. I have been able to separate the words out by using the “Text To Columns” feature. The problem I now have, is that I have 5,600 rows, with about 812 columns, each containing a different word. My original plan was to create a pivot table off of this data, but that didn’t work out as I’d planned. If I want to use a pivot table for this analysis, I’d need all of the words in a single column.

Anyone have any ideas on how to proceed? Is there a way to combine all of the columns into a single column, which would allow me to create the pivot table I need? Or, is there an alternative route that I’m currently blind to, that would help me accomplish the same end goal?

So I've done that recently with US geographic census data, and I think the results are really interesting, but I don't have the kind of expertise to understand if it's arbitrary non-sense, or something actually insightful.

I was visiting my wife's grandmother in rural Missouri, and she made a comment about ""going into town"" to buy some things. Her own town was too small to have what she needed, so she was referring to a nearby larger town. So that got me thinking how the people in that larger town probably also say ""going into town"" to refer to an even larger nearby town, and that trend probably continues until you hit a major city. So I thought it'd be fun to model this concept and see what happens.   

I found a data set with 2010 census population data per town and the longitudinal / latitude coordinates of every town, city, and village in the US. I then wrote a VBA script in Excel that cycles through every single municipality, checking population size and geographic distance, and finds for every town the closest neighboring town that is bigger than itself. If your curious, it took VBA 12 hours to cross-check 30,000 towns. I then had excel draw lines between each town pair, [and plotted that to create a crude map of the US.](https://imgur.com/poUTFlH) 

The results is some kind of population network. I quickly noticed that because each town is only allowed to connect to one other town, [these ""seams"" or ""rifts"" get created](https://imgur.com/RHUOd4T). And those rifts seem to define some kind of boundary to what I guess would be a catchment area.  

But do those areas actually mean anything? Is my methodology too contrived? Am I creating a pattern where there is none? The result is visually interesting, but I honestly have no idea if the resulting map contains any intellectual merit. I'd appreciate any insight you might have. I'd like to share the results, but right now I don't really know what to say about them. 

Thanks."

What I want to do is that, after filling the data let's say with mean, median or standard deviation values or with other machine learning algos, like KNN or XGBoost or some other technique, then I want to add or append those or that particular column(s) at the end of the csv or excel file but not below the actual data, I mean towards the right-end side of the file.

For instance, I've filled the missing data of a particular column using statistical techniques and other ML techniques then I want to add those 'filled values' along with the original values in a new column having it's actual name with underscore and the technique with which the data is filled for that particular feature and add it at the end of the data to the right side of the data. Example, the column or feature is 'phone' then at the right-end side after filling missing values it must show the whole original or actual values plus the values calculated by statistical means or ML means with column name like ""phone\_Mean"" or ""phone\_interpolation"" or 'phone\_KNN' or 'phone\_XGBoost' like that.

What I've done so far ? I've applied the ways from the pandas documentation page and stackoverflow as well, the ones which are generally high enlisted and are in top 7/10 links on google or duckduckgo search engines, but all went in vain.

I'm really facing this issue from last few days due to which I'm crippled at convincing my client. So, it will be great help if you can assist me with some code example using pandas or core python code to support your answer."

Quick additional question: I want to do the same style as above but this time I also need to consider Chickens that doesn't have weight measure for all 21 Days (""missing data""), should be considered dead, hence I want to plot in which Diet they did from. So for example Chicken number 15 has days only up to day 18. Hope you understand. These should also be plotted for each Diet.

In this article, I explain how we can use an oversampling technique called **Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique** or **SMOTE** to balance out our dataset.

## What is SMOTE?

SMOTE is an oversampling algorithm that relies on the concept of nearest neighbors to create its synthetic data. Proposed back in [2002 by Chawla et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1813)., SMOTE has become one of the most popular algorithms for oversampling.

The simplest case of oversampling is simply called oversampling or upsampling, meaning a method used to duplicate randomly selected data observations from the outnumbered class.

Oversampling’s purpose is for us to feel confident the data we generate are real examples of already existing data. This inherently comes with the issue of creating more of the same data we currently have, without adding any diversity to our dataset, and producing effects such as overfitting.

Hence, if overfitting affects our training due to randomly generated, upsampled data– or if plain oversampling is not suitable for the task at hand– we could resort to another, smarter oversampling technique known as synthetic data generation.

Synthetic data is intelligently generated artificial data that resembles the shape or values of the data it is intended to enhance. Instead of merely making new examples by *copying* the data we already have (as explained in the last paragraph), a synthetic data generator *creates* data that is similar to the existing one. Creating synthetic data is where SMOTE shines.

## How does SMOTE work?

To show how SMOTE works, suppose we have an imbalanced two-dimensional dataset, such as the one in the next image, and we want to use SMOTE to create new data points.

&amp;#x200B;

[Example of an imbalanced dataset](https://i.redd.it/9cwc6ao8o1q31.jpg)

For each observation that belongs to the under-represented class, the algorithm gets its K-nearest-neighbors and synthesizes a new instance of the minority label at a random location in the line between the current observation and its nearest neighbor.

In our example (shown in the next image), the blue encircled dot is the current observation, the blue non-encircled dot is its nearest neighbor, and the green dot is the synthetic one.

&amp;#x200B;

[SMOTE’s new synthetic data point](https://i.redd.it/o6o4u0oeo1q31.jpg)

Now let’s do it in Python.

## SMOTE tutorial using imbalanced-learn

In this tutorial, I explain how to balance an imbalanced dataset using the package [**imbalanced-learn**](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

First, I create a perfectly balanced dataset and train a machine learning model with it which I’ll call our “**base model**\*\*”\*\*. Then, I’ll unbalance the dataset and train a second system which I’ll call an “**imbalanced model**.”

Finally, I’ll use SMOTE to balance out the dataset, followed by fitting a third model with it which I’ll name the “**SMOTE’d**\*\*”\*\* model. By training a new model at each step, We’ll be able to better understand how an imbalanced dataset can affect a machine learning system.

## Base model

*Example code for this article may be found at the* [*Kite Blog repository*](https://github.com/kiteco/kite-python-blog-post-code/tree/master/smote)*.*

For the initial task, I’ll fit a [**support-vector machine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) (SVM) model using a created, perfectly balanced dataset. I chose this kind of model because of how easy it is to visualize and understand its decision boundary, namely, the hyperplane that separates one class from the other.

To generate a balanced dataset, I’ll use scikit-learn’s [make\_classification](https://kite.com/python/docs/sklearn.datasets.make_classification) function which creates n clusters of normally distributed points suitable for a classification problem.

My fake dataset consists of 700 sample points, two features, and two classes. To make sure each class is one blob of data, I’ll set the parameter `n_clusters_per_class` to 1.

To simplify it, I’ll remove the redundant features and set the number of informative features to 2. Lastly, I’ll `useflip_y=0.06` to reduce the amount of noise.

The following piece of code shows how we can create our fake dataset and plot it using Python’s Matplotlib.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd
    
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from imblearn.datasets import make_imbalance
    
    # for reproducibility purposes
    seed = 100
    
    # create balanced dataset
    X1, Y1 = make_classification(n_samples=700, n_features=2, n_redundant=0,
                                n_informative=2, n_clusters_per_class=1,
                                class_sep=1.0, flip_y=0.06, random_state=seed)
    
    plt.title('Balanced dataset')
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('y')
    plt.scatter(X1[:, 0], X1[:, 1], marker='o', c=Y1,
               s=25, edgecolor='k', cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
    plt.show()
    # concatenate the features and labels into one dataframe
    df = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(X1), pd.DataFrame(Y1)], axis=1)
    df.columns = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'label']
    # save the dataset because we'll use it later
    df.to_csv('df_base.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')

a perfectly balanced dataset with 1:1 ratio

&amp;#x200B;

[A balanced dataset](https://i.redd.it/n5yc1y2io1q31.jpg)

As you can see in the previous image, our balanced dataset looks tidy and well defined. So, if we fit an SVM model with this data (code below), how will the decision boundary look?

Since we’ll be training several models and visualizing their hyperplanes, I wrote two functions that will be reused several times throughout the tutorial. The first one, `train_SVM`, is for fitting the SVM model, and it takes the dataset as a parameter.

The second function, `plot_svm_boundary`, plots the decision boundary of the SVM model. Its parameters also include the dataset and the caption of the plot.

These are the functions:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    
    
    def train_SVM(df):
       # select the feature columns
       X = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'label']
       # select the label column
       y = df.label
    
       # train an SVM with linear kernel
       clf = SVC(kernel='linear')
       clf.fit(X, y)
    
       return clf
    
    
    def plot_svm_boundary(clf, df, title):
       fig, ax = plt.subplots()
       X0, X1 = df.iloc[:, 0], df.iloc[:, 1]
    
       x_min, x_max = X0.min() - 1, X0.max() + 1
       y_min, y_max = X1.min() - 1, X1.max() + 1
       xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.02), np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.02))
    
       Z = clf.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
       Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
       out = ax.contourf(xx, yy, Z, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, alpha=0.8)
    
       ax.scatter(X0, X1, c=df.label, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, s=20, edgecolors='k')
       ax.set_ylabel('y')
       ax.set_xlabel('x')
       ax.set_title(title)
       plt.show()

To fit and plot the model, do the following:

    df = pd.read_csv('df_base.csv', encoding='utf-8', engine='python')
    clf = train_SVM(df)
    plot_svm_boundary(clf, df, 'Decision Boundary of SVM trained with a balanced dataset')

decision boundary of an SVM model trained with a balanced dataset

Blue dots on the blue side and red dots on the red side means that the model was able to find a function that separates the classes

The image above presents the hyperplane of the base model. On it, we can observe how clear the separation between our classes is. However, what would happen if we imbalance our dataset? How would the decision boundary look? Before doing so, let’s imbalance the dataset by calling the function [make\_imbalance](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.datasets.make_imbalance.html) from the package, **imbalanced-learn**.

First off, apologies if this is not the right sub for this, I wasn't sure quite where to ask this question.

Basically, I have historical data describing which team won an annual sports tournament each year, and I want to create some charts / maps showing the relative strength of the teams over the years.  One obvious measure is the number of tournaments won by each team.  However, this tournament has a long history, and there are plenty of teams who may have dominated in, for example, the 1920s or 1930s but who haven't been any good in a long time.  So I want to create a measure of success which attaches more weight to their recent victories.

My initial thought has been to calculate each team's exponentially weighted moving average number of tournaments won per year - as the tournament is only played once annually, this will yield a number between 0 (if the team has never won a tournament) and 1 (hypothetically, if a team has won every tournament in history).  But I figured this must be a fairly common problem when trying to assess teams' relative strength / dominance, so I wanted to check if there is a better, or commonly accepted, way to calculate this kind of thing?

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW I WAS THINKING OF DOING IT:**

My city has a publicly available assessment roll  data-site.  It records the tax assessor's value for each SBL, for every  year, and if the home was sold in that year, it records the sale price.  

I was thinking of finding the average difference  between the assessed price and the sales price, for each zip, for each  year, and then applying that ""miss"" to all the other homes in that zip.   So if your house is assessed for taxes at $100k,  and the average assessed-sale price diff in your zip code is 10%, then  I'll call your place a $110k house.  

NOTE: If zip turns out to be too small, so that I'm  finding the average with like 2 or 3 places, I'll widen it out to  neighborhoods.

ALSO NOTE: I totally know that the tax assessor's  valuation is not ""what the tax assessor thinks the house would go for"".   I'm just using that so that I have a concrete baseline number to start  from.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY:**

I thought this is reasonablish way of doing it,  since the tax assessor's valuations will be systematically biased.   They'll all be off, but they'll all be off in the same way, so it feels  to me like it would be defensible to apply that  uniform ""assessment vs sale inflater"" across the entire  zip/neighborhood.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT YOU CAN HELP ME WITH:**

I'm just looking to see 

1. if anyone see's an obvious problems with this method,  
2. if anyone what's to suggest another way of doing it,
3. if anyone can tell me there a more acceptable,  ""industry standard"" way of roughly approximating a house value,  preferably one that isn't a massively complicated phd-dissertation of a  method?  Keep in mind, this is just for a home project,  I'm not betting money on these estimates, so just a ""non crazy back of  the envelope number"" is all I'm after."
889,2019-10-09 20:56:44,1570643804.0,dataanalysis,Must we always assume that a subset of a larger population follow the trends of that larger population in the absence of new data?,dfkqdr,FinnyToastCrunch,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/dfkqdr/must_we_always_assume_that_a_subset_of_a_larger/,7.0,10.0,0.0,4909.0,"Large Population = Group A = All murder victims

Subset of Group A = Group B = All murder victims who were witnesses in public trial  


My claim is that a victim in Group B is more likely to be killed as a result of testifying in a trial than a victim in Group A, absent any other information. This should be intuitive because Group B is only witnesses, so obviously this subset should have a higher percentage death rate due to ""witness retaliation"". For example if Group A is made up of 1 million people. And group B is made up of 100 people. and let's say only 1 person in the past has died as a result of witness retaliation. In Group A, that's a 1/million chance that you'll be killed as a result of being involved in a trial if you're a murder victim. But if you're a murder victim in Group B, there's a 1/100 chance that you've been murdered for witness retaliation. It doesn't actually matter how many people have died as a result of witness retaliation, as long as at least person has died, we will see an increased expected percentage of likelihood in Group B than in Group A, simply because we are narrowing the population down to only witnesses. That's my reasoning for why, if witness in a key trial is murdered, assuming we have no other information, it is fair to make an initial assumption that this person is more likely to have died as a result of witness retaliation than someone in the general population of murder victims.  


The person I am debating this with is making the argument that, ""Absent any data about Group B, we cannot assume Group B operates any differently than Group A"" Therefore if there is only a 1/million chance that a victim from Group A dies from witness retaliation, we have to assume that same trend for Group B. Intuitively and logically this seems silly because we are narrowing the field down to only the relevant sub population. Even if we don't know how many people in Group B were murdered as a result of witness retaliation, we still know logically that it will be a higher percentage change than in the general population. My opponent says that even though this seems counter-intuitive, these are the rules of data analysis, and science, in general, and they must be followed.  When making decisions using  data analytics, you use the highest fidelity data you have. In this case, we have general data about murders and that's it. Therefore, the  least bad choice is to use the general trend.  


This comes after the recent murder of that witness in the Dallas trial. I wanted to say that it wasn't absurd to wonder if he was killed out of retaliation. He said I can't even consider that because there exists no real data on ""how often witnesses are murdered for retaliation"" So I must assume it is as probable as the larger population of murder victims who aren't witnesses at all. ""Thems the rules"" apparently.  It's an interesting question to me because there seems to be a contradiction between the rules of logic and the rules of statistics/data analysis.  


Here's the big contradiction. I tried to reforming my stance and say, ""well I shouldn't assume anything. There's no data available on how likely it is that a victim from group B (murdered witnesses) is to be killed for their testimony."" But he counters and says, no, if you want to assume nothing, then you're actually making the claim that subGroup B doesn't follow the trend of the greater Group A. The DEFAULT position has to be that subgroup B follows the trend of Group A. So if to take a ""no stance"" requires burden of proof on my part to show that Group A doesn't follow from group B.   


My question is, is my opponent accurately describing the proper way to analyze this data? Does explanation on why Group B has a higher ""witness assassination rate"" (since it is a smaller group of only relevant victims) than Group A, serve as valid proof that subGroup B is no longer a representative sample of Group A in this scenario? and therefore it is okay to assume that subGroup B doesn't have to follow the trend of Group A?"

Hi all,

A brief introduction about myself, I have a background as a Mechanical engineer but spend most of my career working as an industrial equipment sales representative.

I recently migrated to Canada and are interesting in changing my career focus to become a data analysist.

So, I spend a few weeks researching the roadmap, skills and what to learn to become one, and I have to admit, I felt overwhelmed with all the info and stuff that I don’t know where to start.

As being said, I’m looking for an instructor/mentor to guide me toward my goal, or if you just a new learner like me who want to get someone to discuss with, am all in 

I took a few courses on Udemy and have a decent understanding of basic statistics and probability, Im also comfortable with learning advance excel skills and techniques.

I'm willing to do all the grunt works, any simplest, smallest tasks. You want it done, you name it, I’ll do it. All Im asking is instruction and patient when I ask questions.

I can be reached via [bldhunter3989@gmail.com](mailto:bldhunter3989@gmail.com) or msg here, hope to hear from you guys :D

Any help is appreciated!!!

Cheer!!!"

Sounds easy enough, but the problem is that an appointment type currently has a static price that does not represent this price in the past.

there is also a problem with that there are sometimes prices that are randomly deviating in the cash register for example, I can have appointment type 12 which is an appointment that rarely happens and normally would have a price of 15 euro's. But in some random cases it deviates and goes to 20 for or one appointment and at a random other time to 10.

The problem with this was that my idea was that for each date I would log the most occurring  price and tag them when that price is different from the previous date. But these deviations ,and there are many, really pollute the data. This will happen when logging the price for each day and even for each month with the less occurring appointments while the main occurring appointments are fine.

So I'm wondering if anyone of you has ever dealt with a problem like this?"

So basically, we have a program that incentivizes students to participate in activities. Hopefully, this leads to better student outcomes such as higher GPA, prevents drop outs, etc. What I need to find out is if this program is working, or if we are just rewarding high achieving students and wasting our time on the low achievers. If the later is the case, we need to stop the program and come up with something else. Below is a simplified data set. 

Yr1\_GPA = grade point average for year 1

Yr1\_Points = points earned for attending activities for year 1

Yr1\_Acty\_Cnt = number of activities attended

and so on.

|Student 2|2.9|3.1|1100|1000|16|12|

The actual data set will include 1000's of students and 5 years worth data in the above format. Also, there could be a column indicating whether a student dropped out or not, but I've eliminated that for simplicity and to just focus on the GPA for now.

How do I determine if GPA's increased? Am I rewarding high achievers only? Do high achievers GPA's stay the same? Do lower GPA's improve?

* Each team strength will be  based on the cumulative sum of all players for that team.
* The strength of each player would be the cumulative sum of that player's metrics. To keep it simple, I would just sum all metrics into one value and add those up for each player.

This would be a simple analysis and this won't necessarily validate whether the team got stronger or weaker based on this.   
So, how would you conduct the analysis? What metrics would you use per player to validate a team's projected strength.

AI-generated writing firms are developing new tools that will enable you to ‘converse’ with your database.

“Rather than asking your human analyst for the latest sales performance data — and waiting a few hours for the reply — you can have a dynamic, multi-turn conversation with your data over breakfast,” observes Sharon Daniels, CEO, Arria NLG, an AI-generated writing toolmaker.

Or, “You might begin conversing with a digital or holographic representation of a human,” to secure that same data in conversational form, Daniels adds.

In a phrase: Look for new AI conversational tools to emerge that will enable everyone at your business to secure the deep insights buried in your computer systems – simply by ‘talking with your data.’

# Chapter 2: Why Clean Data?

(Excerpt from[ Ultimate Guide To Cleaning Data with Excel and Google Sheets](https://landing.inzata.com/Ultimate-Guide-to-Cleaning-Data-website-cta))

Data cleansing is the process of spotting and correcting inaccurate data. Organizations rely on data for many things, but few actively address data quality. Whether it’s the integrity of customer addresses or ensuring invoice accuracy. Ensuring effective and reliable use of data can increase the intrinsic value of the brand. Business enterprises must assign importance to data quality.

A data driven marketing survey conducted by Tetra data found that 40% of marketers do not use data to its full effect. Managing and ensuring that the data is clean can provide significant business value.

Improving data quality can eliminate problems like expensive processing errors, manual troubleshooting, and incorrect invoices. Data quality is also a way of life because important data like customer information is always changing and evolving.

Business enterprises can achieve a wide range of benefits by cleansing data and managing quality which can lead to lowering operational costs and maximizing profits.

Who are the heroes who allow the organization to seize and enjoy all these benefits? affectionately refer to these poor souls as **PWCD’s**, or **People Who Clean Data**.  These brave people, and hopefully you are reading this because you hope to be one of them, are the noblest. They often get little recognition even though they clean up the messes of hundreds, if not thousands of other people every day. They are the noble janitors of the data world. And I salute them.

&amp;#x200B;

# Top 5 Benefits of Data Cleaning

## Improve the Efficiency of Customer Acquisition Activities

Business enterprises can significantly boost their customer acquisition and retention efforts by cleansing their data regularly. With the high throughput of the prospecting and lead process, filtering, cleansing, enriching having accurate data is essential to its effectiveness. Throughout the marketing process, enterprises must ensure that the data is clean, up-to-date and accurate by regularly following data quality routines.

Clean data can also ensure the highest returns on email or postal campaigns as chances of encountering outdated addresses or missed deliveries are very low. Multi-channel customer data can also be managed seamlessly which provides the enterprise with an opportunity to carry out successful marketing campaigns in the future as they would be aware of the methods to effectively reach out to their target audience.

## Improve Decision Making Processes

The cornerstone of effective decision making in a business enterprise is data. According to Sirius Decisions, data in an average B2B organization doubles every 12-18 months and though the data might be clean initially, errors can creep in at any time. In fact, in nearly all businesses where data quality is not managed, data quality decay is constantly at work. Each time new records are added; duplicates may be created. Things happening outside your organization, like customers moving and changing emails and telephone numbers will, over time, degrade data quality.

Yet the majority of enterprises fail to prioritize data quality management, or even acknowledge they have a problem! In fact, many of them don’t even have a record of the last time quality control was performed on their customer’s data. More often than not they merely discard or ignore data they believe to be of poor quality, and make decisions through other means. Here you can see that data quality is a massive barrier toward digital transformation and business intelligence, much less every company’s desire to become more Data Driven.

Accurate information and quality data are essential to decision making. Clean data can support better analytics as well as all-round business intelligence which can facilitate better decision making and execution. In the end, having accurate data can help business enterprises make better decisions which will contribute to the success of the business in the long run.

## Streamline Business Practices

Eradicating duplicate and erroneous data can help business enterprises to streamline business practices and avoid wasteful spending. Data cleansing can also help in determining if particular job descriptions within the enterprise can be changed or if those positions can be integrated somewhere else. If reliable and accurate sales information is available, the performance of a product or a service in the market can be easily assessed.

Data cleansing along with the right analytics can also help the enterprise to identify an opportunity to launch new products or services into the market at the right time. It can highlight various marketing avenues that the enterprises can try. In practically any other business process you can name, decisions are made every day, some large, but many small.

It is this systematic pushing of high-quality information down the chain of command, into the hands of individual contributors that helps them improve decisions made at all levels of the organization. Called Operational Intelligence, it is used more commonly for quick lookups and to inform the thousands of decisions that are made every day inside the organization.

## Increase Productivity

Having a clean and properly maintained enterprise dataset can help organizations ensure that the employees are making the best use of their time and resources. It can also prevent the staff of the enterprise from contacting customers with out-of-date information or create invalid vendor files in the system by conveniently helping them to work with clean records thereby maximizing the staff’s efficiency and productivity. High quality data helps reduce the risk of fraud, ensuring the staff has access to accurate vendor or customer data when payments or refunds are initiated.

## Increase Revenue

Business enterprises that work on improving the consistency and increasing the accuracy of their data can drastically improve their response rates which results in increased revenue. Clean data can help business enterprises to significantly reduce the number of returned mails. If there are any time sensitive information or promotions that the enterprise wants to convey to their customers directly, accurate information can help in reaching the customers conveniently and quickly.

Duplicate data is another aspect which can be effectively eradicated by data cleansing. According to Sirius Decisions, the financial impact of duplicate data is directly proportional to the time that it remains in the database.

Duplicate data can significantly drain the enterprise’s resources as they will have to spend twice as much on a single customer. For example, if multiple mails are sent to the same customer, they might get annoyed and might completely lose interest in the enterprise’s products and services.

### Visual Learning

Most human beings cannot listen to or read large amounts of data and readily make sense of what it really means. Human beings tend to benefit from having a sense of how things relate over time and through space, and visualization examples help. In visualization examples, an[ alluvial diagram](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/alluvial-diagram/) of events can help people understand how one thing flows from one place to a new one.

For some sense of how visualization examples can help understanding, consider this[ diagram of asylum seeking in Europe](https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sk%C3%A6rmbillede-2016-01-21-kl.-16.37.57.png). Hearing that certain groups are more likely to have their applications accepted based on their origin and destination is one thing. Conversely, being able to study a diagram that shows the flow of people and their acceptance and rejection statuses makes it easier to process the idea.

There are four core data visualization tools that can be used to represent insights. These are:

* Color
* Shape
* Visual movement
* Spatial relationships

Just being able to differentiate to color-coded data points may go a long way to increase your understanding of the meaning of a piece of research. A company’s data team might visualize questions about new and established customers, for example, by coloring new users with red dots and old users with blue dots. This can make it easier to follow along as you see how changes in the customer base have shifted over time. Compare that to trying to fish out data from a spreadsheet.

### Long-Term Engagement

Particularly in the era where data visualization tools like dashboards can be made available to everyone who has a phone, tablet or laptop, there’s a lot to be said for the engagement[ value](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/value/) of data[ visualizations](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/visualizations/). Let’s say a CFO who was presented with a report at a meeting wants to refer back to materials from the session. Rather than having to sift through papers or ask someone to email them a particular slide, they can simply pull up the company’s data visualization tools and check the presentation there.

More importantly, increased interactivity can keep decision-makers engaged with data. Being able to click on items and see how different factors shift can improve engagement significantly. Especially when working with parties that aren’t 100% sold on your ideas, it can be helpful for them to scan and interact with data over several iterations.

People also enjoy interacting with data. Switching back and forth using the data visualization tools between an operations current-year report and one from last year, for example, can foster engagement and interest.

### Promoting Culture Change

Becoming a data-centric organization requires bringing along decision-makers, employees, contractors, customers and other stakeholders. You want to onboard as many of these parties as possible as your company starts valuing data as a part of its decision-making process. Whenever possible, you also don’t want to leave people behind.

Data visualizations can help folks get onboard with a culture change that’s moving toward data and analytics. Improvements in engagement, learning and efficiency can help them feel why the culture change has to happen and how it benefits them.

Stakeholders will eventually become more proficient as they settle into patterns of using visualizations. They will come to understand and apply statistical concepts such as:

* Regression to the mean
* Outliers
* Hypothesis testing
* Statistical confidence and uncertainty

They’ll also begin to appreciate why certain data visualization techniques were employed.

Over time, analytics insights can become a product that stakeholders start to demand rather than dread seeing. People will whip out their phones and tablets to check up on the state of the company in real-time via dashboards. Instead of feeling like the culture change has been imposed upon them, they will start to see it as just something they can’t do without.

1. Both my degrees were primarily qualitative in nature. I took introductory courses in Maths, Stats, and Computing during my undergrad; but didn't acquire any serious quantitative skill.
2. Learning new skills does not intimidate me. I am a self-taught graphic designer and also pay a couple of musical instruments.
3. I had a strong command over Maths and Stats before pursuing a Political Science major but lost touch over time.

Any and all suggestions are highly appreciated:

1. If you think self-education is a viable option; what should be my route?
2. If you think I need a degree (or other formal qualification), what would you suggest?
3. Can I utilise my qualitative skills and theoretical nuance in order to secure an entry-level job? If yes, what is the minimum I need to learn in order to get my foot in the door?

I have a feeling I may finally get a job offer after completing the technical assessment in Excel (which was extremely easy)

However, this job pays 5k less than my current job, and it is solely working in Excel. I would be getting Excel files from clients and answering business questions for them with Excel; then it gets sent back and they can use my formulas for future analyses. The company is a software company, so there are engineers and such in the office as well, but as far as I know, this role will never incorporate programming.

Part of the job description states:

* **Working with Excel reports to structure, import and validate data**
* **Import spreadsheets for the purpose of displaying payments due to sales agents**
* **Clearly communicating processes in a written and verbal manner when questions are presented about the methods used in your analysis**
* **Validate that payments are accurately calculated on multiple levels in a hierarchy**
* **Working with the support team as a data analyst resource to assist with client requests involving math and Excel formulas**

Is it worth it to take a job like this, in hopes that in 1 year those SQL jobs will be more likely to take me? Or should I keep trying to land a job utilizing more advanced skills? I'm conflicted"

Manual cleaning calls for extensive work, though, and it also can induce human errors along the way. For this reason, automated solutions, often based on basic statistical models, are used to eliminate flawed entries. It’s a good idea, though, to develop some understanding of the top strategies for dealing with the job.

### Pattern Matching

A lot of undesirable data can be cleaned up using common pattern-matching techniques. The standard tool for the job is usually a programming language that handles regular expressions well. Done right, a single line of code should serve the purpose well.

**1) Cleaning out and fixing characters** is almost always the first step in data cleaning. This usually entails removing unnecessary spaces, [HTML](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/html/) entity characters and other elements that might interfere with machine or human reading. Many languages and spreadsheet applications have TRIM functions that can rapidly eliminate bad spaces, and regular expressions and built-in functions usually will do the rest.

**2) Duplicate removal** is a little trickier because it’s critical to make sure you’re only removing true duplicates. Using other good data management techniques will make duplicate removal simpler, such as indexing. Near-duplicates, though, can be tricky, especially if the original data entry was performed sloppily.

### Efficiency Improvement

While we tend to think of data cleaning as mostly preparing information for use, it also is helpful in improving efficiency. [Storage](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/storage/) and processing efficiency are both ripe areas for improvement.

**3) Converting fields** makes a big difference sometimes to [storage](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/storage/). If you’ve imported numerical fields, for example, and they all appear in text columns, you’ll likely benefit from turning those columns into integers, decimals or floats.

**4) Reducing processing overhead** is also a good choice. A project may only require a certain level of decimal precision, and rounding off numbers and storing them in smaller memory spaces can speed things up significantly. Just make sure you’re not kneecapping required decimal precision when you use this approach.

### Statistical Solutions

Folks in the stats world have been trying to find ways to improve [data quality](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/data-quality/) for decades. Many of their techniques are ideal for data cleaning, too.

**5) Outlier removal and the use of limits** are common ways to analyze a dataset and determine what doesn’t belong. By analyzing a dataset for extreme and rare data points, you can quickly pick out what might be questionable data. Be careful, though, to recheck your data afterward to verify that low-quality data was removed rather than data about exceptional outcomes.

Limiting factors also make for excellent filters. If you know it’s impossible for an entry to register a zero, for example, installing a limit above that mark can eliminate times when a [data source](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/data-source/) simply returned a blank.

**6) Validation models** are useful for verifying that your data hasn’t been messed up by all the manipulation. If you see validation numbers that scream that something has gone wrong, you can go back through your data cleaning process to identify what might have misfired.

I am writing today because I am in need of guidance, advice or anything that is helpful... I started a data analytics course a couple months ago. Before beginning it I was so excited about the course. I’ve always wanted to do something with technology and I thought what better way than become a data analyst? Everything went well, as I’ve said before... but as time went on I started becoming lazy and uninterested. Mostly because I feel like I am so hard on myself and think I will never be able to be a data analyst since this is my first time ever coding. I can remember the syntax of a language quite well if I repeatedly do it but I have never gotten the grasp of the logic. Not saying on everything... I can do simple tasks but when it becomes way too hard I get flustered and anxious and there goes my 2 hours that should have been doing my homework but instead I am stressing about not being able to code. I started thinking that maybe coding is just not for me. But I have payed for my course well in advance and would not like to waste the money. The first thing the community will say will probably be “study more” but I have gotten unmotivated that I have started studying less and less. I understand that if something is hard for you to learn then thats a good thing because you’re actually learning something.  Another thing I forgot to mention is how my classes go. I don’t really like the way of teaching and it bothers me a lot. Sure, I’ll do the exercises in class and figure it out but its never cemented in my head. The explanation of why this code is like this or that like this is so lacking. I am also better at remembering things if I write them out but obviously I cant write every code down... right(or wrong)? If anybody has felt this way and was able to come back up and motivate themselves can you please share some tips, advice, etc? 

Thank you so much"

&amp;#x200B;

I hope i can explain my problem in an understandable manner.

&amp;#x200B;

I've an ID range from 1 to 9999.

I also have a table/list of arrays (\~ 5 million rows) with each row containing a variable number of IDs (1 to 9999).

No ID can be added twice.

&amp;#x200B;

What i want to achieve is the following:

 \- analyze the list and find a ""common"" set/bundle of IDs

 \- the bundle should cover the highest possible amount of entries

 \- then i could add this bundle ID for each approbriate row and delete all IDs which the bundle contains

 \- it's basically a consolidation ? can i call it like this ?

&amp;#x200B;

What i've came up so far is:

 \- i need to create some sort of bundle-patterns before (with the given ID range)

 \- then search the list and check which bundle-pattern has the most matches

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so to create bundle-patterns i guess i need some restrictions/requirements.

ID order doesn't matter.

A fixed number of entries for all bundle-patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i've found how to calculate the total possible combinations: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery\_mathematics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_mathematics)

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this ... i get some absurd big numbers :(

Even if i limit the number of entries for the bundle-patterns to something like 10 i get BILLIONS of combinations.

&amp;#x200B;

I've no clue if i'm on the right track or if this ""consolidation"" process is reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot for any feedback and ideas!"

So I'm interviewing with a company who train graduates in data analysis, then either keep them in-house or help them join staff with companies they work with. Got the interview after doing an online application then having a very relaxed telephone discussion.

It's my first interview in the field of computing. So I'm wondering what I should expect in terms of competence questions. 


I've had a look around the Web a little to see what people say on this. My plan is to prepare for soft skill questions and questions about research and inferential statistics. Then try and put my experience and skills into ways which can demonstrate my ability to do valued analysis. 

My background is in social sciences. I have some research experience and a lot practice with spss and excel, a little with R and I've been working on learning python on my own. Been working hard on the python part as it's mentioned in the ad, like I did my first Pearson correlation yesterday which is super happy with. 

Any advice to help me land the job?"

As a Data/BI Analyst I always have to report all types of data to all kinds of people inside the company I work with (which is a german insurance company). A few years ago I discovered the IBCS and since then I often apply them to my reports. Unfortunately it is no standard in the company yet, so I keep informing people about it.  


What the IBCS do is implementing standards for reports (preferably company-wide but not necessarily) so the way the data is reported is independent from the person that reports it. You may have seen it in your company as well, that e.g. a revenue report from one devision doesn't look the same as the revenue report of another devision. Some deliver barcharts, some deliver pie-charts, some deliver tables and so on and so forth. The problem with this is, that the customer (in this case the management) always has to get into the specifics of every report and maybe doesn't understand them or come up with false conclusions. With the IBCS you can minimize this problem.  


Some industries already have a high standardization for good reason. Think of sheet music. They always look the same, so musicians all over the world can read them. Engineers have it. Circuit diagrams look the same all over the world. Architects have it so building plans could be understanded by everyone familiar with it. Business reports DON'T have it. Why is that?  


Besides of that, the IBCS give valuable tips for data presentation in general, so the message you want to deliver is actually delivered and not misinterpreted because of bad report-design. They use the so called SUCCESS formula which stands for Say, Unify, Condense, Check, Express, Simplify and Structure.  


If you want to get further information, I recommend the Homepage and the YouTube channel:  
1. [https://www.ibcs.com/](https://www.ibcs.com/)  
2. [https://www.youtube.com/user/HICHERT](https://www.youtube.com/user/HICHERT)

  
Unfortunately not all (but some) of the videos are in english, but most of them have english subtitles.  


This one is my favourite and entertaining. It goes about the aspect of Simplify (unfortunately in german, but I think understandable just by watching): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhkiMX8zbDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhkiMX8zbDE)  
The standard-translation-function from YouTube is ok (but not perfect) too. Give it a shot.  


The IBCS Standards are available in the version 1.1 for download (PDF) on the website: [https://www.ibcs.com/product/ibcs-standards-pdf/](https://www.ibcs.com/product/ibcs-standards-pdf/)  
You can get a copy for free, if you apply for membership with the IBCS Association (passive membership is for free!).  


I want to mention, that I have no business relationship with them and you can have all the information for free. They sell a book (which I haven't read yet) and give courses (not online, I think). I am just very convinced of the concept and I would like to spread the word. Due to this I will crosspost this article in the following subreddits:  
r/dataisbeautiful  
r/datascience

Feel free to share it in other communities as well.

I created a Google Form for me and my friends to fill out after every game, and then I ran some analysis on it. I'm still learning, so I want to know if this is good analysis or what other analysis I can do. 

This sub also seems like it could use more discussion, so let's get it going!

\##The Form##

The questions were

1. What class were you playing? (Support, Damage, Tank)
2. How many gold medals did you get?
3. How many silver medals did you get?
4. How many bronze medals did you get?
5. How many eliminations did you have?
6. How many times did you die?
7. How many people were in your group?
8. Did you win?

Then I added in a row for total medals, and ratio of kills to deaths

This is a small snippet of the data:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](iyj3cnqwgb341)

That led to over 100 responses. Then I tested for significance, removed everything that wasn't significant, and got down to this:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](9rlfeq32hb341 ""Looks like gold, silver medals were predictive of winning, along with kills and deaths"")

&amp;#x200B;

What was interesting was that kills and deaths were both significant, while the ratio of Kills / Deaths wasn't.

Then I wanted to predict a win.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](capkhd69hb341)

So what I think this is saying is that if you get 3 golds, 1 silver, 10 kills, 2 deaths, then 'fit' is the % chance you have to win with those stats? However, the lower and upper bounds are below and above 0 and 1 respectively. I don't know how to make that a smaller range.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I've done so far! It feels super rough, and I don't feel like I've necessarily nailed it yet. What can I do better with my current stuff? What else can I add? What would you do with that data? Let's talk!! I'm just learning but don't want to just be another ""hey what should i do?"", and instead wanted to show what I'm working on even though I'm a noob."

* How to check your own work to ensure you are calculating the data correctly 
* Margin of Error and Statistical Significance
* Working with ambiguity and what to do when you cant get the exact data point.
* That when you update something from a tracker, you always have to use the exact definitions to ensure the comparisons are apples to apples.

I am trying to analyze single neuron data from my deep learning model. More specifically, I have 7 layers of the model, each layer contains different numbers of neurons, ranging from 256 to 16384. 

I would like to analyze the data of 240 testing trials to see the neuron activation patterns. For example, for the #7 layer, there is a  (240, 256) data, which means 256 neurons' reaction to 240 testing trials.

The goal is to find out if there's any pattern of the neurons. Or even better, that we're able to identify some classical patterns. Here are some properties of the data:

1. The values are all positive
2. The values spread across different scales, ranging from 10\^-5 to 10\^0
3. The values are mostly very small
4. Different neurons can have very different distribution. For example, #158 neuron has mean = 3 and a flat distribution, while most neurons have mean = \~10\^2, and very steep distribution

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue of analyzing these data. Please share some advice. Thanks a lot!  (also cross-post to r/statistics)"

We can use [big data](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/big-data/) to develop better [predictive analytics](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/predictive-analytics/) tools to identify risks and take the right precautions. One of the best examples is using [big data](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/big-data/) to protect driver safety.

Companies that use [big data](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/big-data/) can create better contingency plans. They will make sure that the right measures are in place to avoid the risk of injuries and deaths on the road.

# The Role of Big Data in Highway Safety

Car accidents are the cause of 1.25 million deaths per year, with an additional 20 – 50 million injuries or disabilities relating to automobile accidents. Big data is being mined to be able to improve driver safety. But how?

**Predictive Analysis and Crash Maps**

Tennessee conducted a crash prediction program in 2013 that analyzed crashes based on reports, traffic conditions, and weather for specific 6-by-7-mile-wide areas. The data was used to create maps that officers and highway patrol used to create safety checkpoints.

New enforcement plans were put in place so that officers could patrol in areas where accidents were most common.

Crash response time dropped by 33% and fatalities fell by 3% as a result. This was an impressive set of results. The other benefits shouldn’t be ignored.

Big data can also help cities understand their road usage and risks. I-80, where it connects to US 395 in Nevada, was designed to have 90,000 vehicles on the roadway per day, but rapid growth in the area has led to more than 260,000 vehicles per day on this road. Cities can use big data to predict how traffic will increase, offer better maintenance and expansion plans, and generally increase safety on congested roadways.

Predictive analysis helps officials take action so that they can lower the risks of accidents and help decrease response time to accidents.

# Autonomous Driving Enhancement

Autonomous driving will be able to increase the safety of drivers, and it is big data that will help push this technology to the mainstream. We’re already seeing vehicles that can use blind spot detection or apply the brakes based on the actions of vehicles ahead of the driver’s vehicle.

With 10 million self-driving vehicles expected to be on the road by 2020, these vehicles should help reduce some of the $871 billion that car crashes cost the economy each year.

**Telematics to Coach New Drivers**

New systems are already being developed to capture data in real-time and be able to sift through [big data](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/big-data/) to analyze a driver’s behaviors. The power of data will be used for telematics so that new drivers can effectively be “coached” on how they drive.

Harsh braking habits, rapid speed increases or even speeding can all be logged and analyzed.

The systems will rely on [big data](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/big-data/) to better help new and seasoned drivers understand their driving habits. Similarly, trucking fleets and other commercial transportation fleets will be able to use telematics to keep a close eye on their drivers.

When telematics is in use, reports can be made and actions can be taken to curb bad driving behaviors.

Data can also take into account a driver’s actions. The idea is that the vehicle will be able to function differently, based on the driver’s actions, so that the vehicle’s braking or acceleration is altered. [Big data](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/big-data/) can also help eliminate speeding, or it can be used to determine whether a driver is wearing their seatbelt. In the latter case, the vehicle will force the driver to put on a seatbelt before the vehicle starts.

As [big data](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/big-data/) continues to be used, vehicle safety will improve.

I was able to perform the segmentation on the basis of the initial cluster centres on SPSS but noticed the following problem:  


One of the five segments was drastically larger in size compared to the original segmentation (24 % vs. 37 %). I suspected a data weighting problem, and weighted the data similarly to the original survey, but that didn't help. Looking at the responses of both surveys, I noticed that the problematic, overrepresented, segment had the highest 1-5 point answers on most of the cluster-defining factors, and that the newest survey had generally higher answers on most of the factors (0.13 higher overall average on the 1-5 scale).  


My question is the following: How would I go about adjusting my survey answer to be, on average, 0.13 points lower in a manner that is viable from a statistics point of view? And could there be something else I am missing here?

Well, buzzwords aside, it can get confusing to get lost in the hype if you’re new to the data and analytics space. With people spending an increasing amount of their lives online on their smartphones, tablets, PCs and even TVs there is a wealth of data being created a digital footprint of sorts for every prospective customer out there. Now, this data is incredibly powerful if the right insights can be gleaned from it and the right actions are taken as a response to them.

However, even though data is being collected, often companies make the mistake of being paralyzed by the information and not leveraging it in terms of business strategy. Bain and Company reported that less than [4%](http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/the-value-of-big-data.aspx) of the world’s top companies are currently using these data insights in the right way.

So, if you’ve still not figured out a big data strategy for your company, here’s why you need to be doing it as of ‘yesterday’."

I'm very accustomed to using Excel to load and clean data and then build PivotTables. For example, maybe I have records of 1,000 transactions and I want to group them by name and see how much each person has spent (simple example). Easy for a PivotTable. I'm very fast and comfortable in Excel so I can quickly look over my data and figure out whether things are consistent and make sense. Unfortunately I need to move outside of Excel for 2 reasons:

1) I'm now working on datasets with many millions of records, so Excel simply can't handle it anymore. Even if it can load one of my files, it takes forever to do anything to it.

2) I need to cross-reference across different datasets to group and evaluate using data from among them.

A couple specific things I need to be able to do:

1) Within one dataset, group certain fields together and show sums of values from another field like I would do in a PivotTable.

2) On that same PivotTable, add another field that includes sums matching certain criteria from another dataset.

I have some basic familiarity querying SQL databases and took an R course years ago, and it seems like either of these could perhaps be workable (I prefer more graphical, less command line). I have a web hosting account with MySQL that I could try and figure out how to set up and connect to, if that's a good way to go.

Are there any other things you'd suggest I should be looking at?"

Hi.  Hopefully this is the right sub to ask this, and I can make proper sense.

I have an existing database of portfolios of monetary accounts.  I'm looking for a way to aggregate the account-level data of portfolios that we may purchase, by state (or any of several categories), and compare them to porfolios we already own aggregated the same way.  

Ideally, I would end up with a way to determine that SamplePort (in the tables below) more closely resemples PortfolioA than PortfolioB in terms of the % of total volume and average balance by category.  And I need to run the Sample against hundreds of portfolios consisting of millions of accounts in order to identify the portfolios most like the Sample.

The data sits in a MySQL db, but we could implement this in Python or R if needed.  I'm certainly willing to do more research, if I only knew what to search for or the proper way to ask the question(s).

Please help.  Thanks.

I had an interview question recently that had me a bit stumped and I was curious on how to best approach it.  (I ended up not getting the position though)  


Question:

 I don't have access to the complete question anymore but it was essentially this.  There was a database with around 5 different tables, and I needed to answer about 5 questions against the data that required a lot of joining / combining of multiple different tables together, and deleting columns I don't need .   It was required that I submit a jupyter notebook as the solution using python.   


My solution:  

I tried to do everything via pandas, which proved tricky and I was pretty new at it and trying to learn as I went. I ran into a lot of bugs and spent most of my time debugging.   I wondered though if it would have been better to just dump the files into a new database and run sql queries against it, which would have made the query process fairly easy but I wasn't familiar with setting up databases with jupyter and was worried I'd spend way too long debugging issues, and it didn't look like I had a way to submit a running db.  (I found out later about SQL lite which might have been a good solution).    


What would have been your optimal approach to this?"

I don’t know if this is the proper place to post, but it’s the closest subreddit I’ve found for what I’m looking for.

Let’s say that I have two production lines. One production line produces Product A and the other production line produces Product B.

Each production line has a dedicated set of employees (always more than one employee per production line) that produce their respective products. Product A is a fairly simple product and the goal is that 100 Product As are produced for every labor hour worked on the line. Product B is a more complex product and therefore more time consuming too produce. So, the goal is that 10 Product Bs are produced for every labor hour worked on that line.

The vast majority of the time, the two lines work independently of each other. However, the employees that work on the A line are fully trained and fully capable of working on the B line and vice-versa. There are some times where one production line may be a bit overwhelmed and an employee or two from the other line will be brought in to help relieve the bottleneck.

When looking at how successful the individual lines are at meeting goals, this ends up being fairly simple math. Take the number of Product As and divide that by the labor hours worked on the A line and you get Product As produced per labor hour. Same for the Product B line. You can then do some simple analysis on this and say that based on the products produced per labor hour goal, you can determine how many labor hours theoretically should have been spent to produce the actual number of products made. So, for a goal of 100 Product As per labor hour, if we spent 24 labor hours, we should have produced 2,400 As. If we only produced 1,800, we know that something was affecting efficiency negatively. If we produced 3,000, we can assume that an improvement of some sort was met and figure out what we can learn from that.

When thinking about each individual line, this is all simple enough.

The problem I am trying to solve comes from when the two lines share labor in those times where it’s necessary. When we consider that we actually have a labor-pool from two lines available to potentially produce on both lines, this muddies the math. Assume that I know the total number of labor hours combined spent between the two lines, but that I *don’t* know where those labor hours were spent (it could be any combination of all the labor hours spent on the Product A production line and none on the Product B production line to the exact opposite and every combination in between). If, between the two lines, we spent a total of 40 labor hours and we produced 2,600 of Product A and 130 of Product B, how do I determine whether we met goals and what the gap between goals and actual results for each line was?

I hope this makes sense.

Let me introduce myself… 

I am a hobbyist in the field of the misappropriation of popular culture, for the purposes of science, education and meme generation. I’m currently thinking of a community project where we source Trump statements, provide additional metadata annotations (dates etc) in an open data repository. 

Now the media has been keeping a tally of falsehoods already, and with a count around 16k, this surely allows for some statistical treatment?!

Perhaps a collaboration of sorts is required to thoroughly investigate our President’s mental health, in an open transparent and truly modern format; that we all deserve.

Given an interest by the community, we could investigate things like the temporal sparsity of falsehoods/misleading statements, sentiment analysis, bipolar phrase distribution. 

I’m sure the smart folks here can think of far more creative ideas and ways to transform and visualise such a dataset.

I personally want to investigate if there's some sort of Zipf's law, correlating some sensible metric of the gravity of a lie, to its frequency of use by Trump. But thats just my personal itch.

Now Trump could just be the start, all world leader need scrutiny, an in the spirit of impartiality lets invesitgate them all.

Anyway let me know kind Redditors if I’m onto something, or if I should just get my Doc to boost my meds that one last level higher and recline into apathy :)

Best regards and good day.

I'm a rookie in quantitative data analysis. I'm working on a survey of  student responses across a number of schools. There are about 8  questions, and in the data there are YES's NO's but also quite few item  non-responses dotted about. (I'm pretty sure it was a box for YES and  NO, so some didn't cross either).   
 

I'm doing some volunteer impact research and so I want to choose a  defensible methodology to deal with item non-responses, but ideally I  would choose a methodology that maximises the positive (yes) answers. I  want to help this charity get funding.  
 

So, across all the schools, I've quantified answers to each separate  question in this way: percentage of YES \*amongst those who answered\*. So  I'm not counting item non-response as NO. I think this is okay (?), and  if anyone has a term for this approach, that would be helpful to know  when it comes to presenting my methdology.   
 

However, would it be problem if I used this to count all the answers,  across all the questions (percentage of YES \*amongst those who  answered\*)? My worry is that I would be ignoring the participants who  put no response for some questions, but then answered other questions.  Seems like I should somehow take account of them? I'm not sure, it just  felt wrong to me intuitively, maybe someone can help?

I’m taking on 3 new projects at work, one of them involves writing a forecasting model to forecast daily call volume. I have 3 entire years (Jan 2017 - Jan 2020) of daily call volume to use.

I’m reading up on ARMA, ARIMA, Vector Autoregression, etc but am unsure how to determine which is best. The call volume has decreased significantly YoY, 35% decrease from 2017 to 2018 and 12% decrease 2018 to 2019. Definitely a downward trend but no real seasonality so I’ve ruled out ARMA (please let me know if I’m right to). I’ll be using python and have briefly looked at the statsmodels package which has all/most of the models I’ve seen so far. 

What model (even if I did t mention it) would you use for such a dataset and goal? Am I going about this incorrectly?

Yesterday I posted a question about this theme but then I realized It was too vague to allow people to help me.

Sorry if some questions could seem trivial or stupid.

I have a dataset of about a hundred people that are distinguished, in a column, by an identifier with whom I can distinguish three belonging groups: The control group, the Diagnosed Disease group, and a Group at Risk Developing the Disease. Then I have the sex and the age of the people in the dataset. I'm required, by the task, to do some prediction on a variable (that so will be my **y**) indicating an ordinal variable that aggregates some specific items from a **Rating Scale** to detect the disease (so a part of the scale). It is an ordinal variable; I think I can consider it as a continuous one and do the regression.

I'm asked to use some biomarkers to predict my **y**: they are *from experimental measurements* done on the people on my dataset; they are about 20 variables. I'm also asked to consider, if possible, some *biographical data* to predict my y, but especially the above-mentioned biomarkers from *experimental examinations*. There are also some data about *familiar history* (e.g. with the respect to the disease), but I think I can ignore them. So an idea is to take a subset and considering only the experimental biomarkers of interest for the task and biographical data of interest (ignoring other data), to use the function lm(y \~ .) where ""."" will indicate the x1...xn predictors, to find an approximative predicting equation, checking with summary(lm()) if the F-statistics and t-test produce a pvalue&lt;0.05.

But some people said me that the **ID** (that describes the belonging group: control, risk, disease) is useful for the analysis. Do you think is it necessary or Can I also proceed in another way? Somebody said me to use the ID as a 3 level variables. I have to add that the ID has the value ""-"" in all the individuals of the control group. Somebody said me it's natural because you cannot rate someone's disease if he or she is asymptomatic. So I can replace ""-"" with 0. Do you think is it correct? In the dataset I also have some information about medication (medical drugs taken) but I thought to ignore them.

1)I'm required to check the **model assumptions**. How can I do it? What's the R tool and commands that can help me in doing it?

2)I have to divide data in **training set** and **testing set**. I have never studied machine learning so far so I'm a bit confused about it. What will this operation consist in this specific context? How can I do it in R?

3)About the abovementioned different groups (control, risk, disease), how should I use it? I think a way is to split my dataset in three ones. But then, what have I to do? How could I use this three different datasets?"

I'm in Medellin, Colombia and it may be a bit hard to do it here in person although not impossible. But if you had to do it online how would you do it? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a manager in an email marketing agency and I have a lot of marketing experience, I've been studying analyzing and visualizing data with google sheets,  Azure, R, Python, and SQL. I know the basics so far and I'm still going at it. My goal is to get a junior data analyst/business intelligence job. But I've checked the data and 60% of people get hired via networking so you know, that's what I'm aiming to do and I'm just trying to find ways to do it.  


tldr; Did you get your current data analyst job via networking? how did you do it? and if you had to do it from zero how would that look?"

I am a graduate student about to graduate with my MBA in management, and I am currently in a data analytics class. For one of the assignments, I am supposed to interview someone who works with data regularly. As I am still in college and not working full time yet, I don’t know anyone who I can interview. Since this is the case, I am going to leave my questions here with the hope that I will receive answers to most– if not all– of them. Thank you in advance to all who choose to respond. 

1) What is it you do? (Job title, organization, responsibilities, etc.)
2) Where does the data you work with come from, and how is it formatted, accessed, and shared?
3) What is a specific instance where data analysis made a significant difference in the quality of a desision? Is there a scenario where lack of data or analysis hindered decision making?
4) What tools do you work with? How do you use Excel?
5) How did you gain your experience? (formal education, self-taught, on-the-job training, etc.)
6) Where do you see your job– as well as data analytics in general– going in the future?

Once again, thank you so much for anyone who responds. You can dm me or just comment. Any information is greatly appreciated."

I want to measure if improving a software feature has reduced the number of phone calls related to that feature.   Currently my approach ( if we could start by just aligning on this before contemplating super fancy ways ) is just the number of calls over the number of sum all customer employees(before filtering down by feature type ).   Question 1) So first if I wanted to set an overall goal for 2020 that is saying we want a 5% reduction is customer service calls (across all features ) and I used a time series / exponential smoothing method to forecast how many calls there will be in 2020 and how many new units , by day. At first I was like should just do 5% less than the number of calls % number of customers or should I do 5% less only to the number of calls only and then divide that by the number of customers ? The 5% less being “ hey this was our forecast ie what we thought we would have but since we’re investing in making better software we should have 5% less customer service calls “. Just not sure if I should change the total number of new customers forecast to be down 5%.    Question 2) If I want to filter by a certain feature , Let’s the say log in page feature. And I want to know when we built a new ui for it , Did that reduce customer service calls. Should i have that filter for customer calls related to login over the total amount of customers in total or over the number of customer employees within that pool of customers who reached out regarding log in (ie if 3 different customers with 10 employees reached out then it would be 3 calls over 30. Vs 3 calls over 100 [assuming I have 10 customers in total with 10 employees])"

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a full fledged analyst for about 8 months now; prior to that I did what I would call data analysis lite (aka, no real SQL work to be done, but lots of SQL-environment work). In my previous job I was primarily an account executive that had to do my own analysis of data. It was nice in a way because I always knew what I was looking for, but it also meant that I had to split my time between the two tasks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am working as more of a support role, I'm running into a particular problem that seems to be pervasive to the IT world. I don't know the right questions to ask during the initial phases of building stored procedures / large scale reporting projects. It seems like every time I have a large project, there is an inherent disconnect that causes miscommunication. We almost always have to go back and revise things because of silly little things like misunderstanding jargon or interpreting the intent behind a request inaccurately. This is by far my biggest issue I face at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you all have some sort of go to set of questions when starting on a project? How do you make sure that there isn't anything lost in translation when talking to non-IT staff that doesn't necessarily understand more technical terms or aspects? How do you work with people who consistently don't know the right words to use (this happens a lot, and I don't get upset with the people; they're trying their best)? 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I guess the ultimate question here is how do you make sure that you and the various departments / people you work with are ALWAYS on the same page? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks ahead of time! You are all beautiful."

I'm from a pure accounting background, and have been a Financial Accountant for the past 2 years.

I'm interested in transitioning into Data Analytics as a career change.

Has anyone here done something similar? 

In terms of studies, would I need to get a degree in Data Analytics before the transition?

I've looked up some Master of Data Analytics courses and they take 4 years part time; I'm assuming after the 4 years, I'd need to start at an entry level role again. Would this even be worth it? 

Anyone have any advice for this transition?

&amp;#x200B;

Any input would be appreciated."

Just wondering on what kind of questions or the type of test there could possibly be for a position like this?

[Good overview article](https://robotwritersai.com/artificial-intelligence-generated-writing/) on how artificial intelligence -- which of course features a great deal of data analysis and manipulation -- is automating writing.

Here's an excerpt from the intro:

Twenty Twenty will continue to see an embrace of AI-generated writing by virtually every major industry.

Increasing numbers of news outlets will continue to boldly experiment with the tools — as will advertisers and public relations pros.

More individual businesses will also grab the technology to auto-write company reports based on info from their databases.

And AI personalization – the ability to generate highly customized news and other writing based on what smartphone readers are tapping, swiping and commenting on as they interact with text – will continue to crop-up in a number of implementations.

But the tech will also inspire its fair share of controversy.

Many writers — especially journalists and copywriters — will continue to view AI as synonymous with job loss.

And media watchers will continue to sound the alarm as free AI software capable of generating fake news will continue to be released to the general public.

All told, scores of trends will impact the spread of AI-generated writing across the globe.

This article offers analysis on the Top Ten."

The goal is to identify disciplines with the most overlap in courses.  For example, Sociology-101 could appear under humanities, child educational, and marketing.

I've identified cluster analysis as the best way to approach this, but I'm stumped in what type of cluster analysis is best suited for my goal. Also, I'll be using categorical data, which I can't find much resources for.  I have access to SPSS and Excel.

I have a problem that I'm trying to solve using clusters (I'm currently doing a huge script for this, but I want to know what's common across 3 different variables and thought python already has some library to help me with this).


```
{
	""D1"": {
		""v1"": [""x"", ""y"", ""z""],
		""v2"": [""n""],
		""v3"": [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e"", ""f""]
	},
	""D2"": {
		""v1"": [""v"", ""w"", ""x"", ""y"", ""z""],
		""v2"": [""m"", ""n""],
		""v3"": [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]
	},
	""D3"": {
		""v1"": [""y"", ""z""],
		""v2"": [""n""],
		""v3"": [""a"", ""e"", ""d""]
	},
	""D4"": {
		""v1"": [""w"", ""z""],
		""v2"": [""m""],
		""v3"": [""a"", ""e"", ""d""]
	},
	""D5"": {
		""v1"": [""t"", ""z""],
		""v2"": [""m""],
		""v3"": [""b""]
	},
	""D6"": {
		""v1"": [""u"", ""v"", ""z""],
		""v2"": [""m""],
		""v3"": [""a"", ""e"", ""d""]
	}
}
```



Is there any way to gain knowledge from here, say:
- Assuming v1 is a fixed variable: D1, D2, and D3 are the most common items since they share the biggest number of v1's (y and z)?; D5 is definitely not a common item since ""z"" is seen across all of them and ""t"" is not seen in any other item?; 
- Dependency logic: D4 and D6 could be considered common, since they share some v1 similarly to D2 (""w"" and ""v"" respectively), perhaps because some other variable like v2 or v3 is influencing?


I'm not sure if I abstracted too much, but for obvious reasons, I can't give the actual context, but I'll think of another way to name them to maybe help understand the problem. If the above example doesn't make sense to you, all I need to know is if there's a way to either plot them and get some insights from them (while keeping their dependencies on each other), or throw them into some magic buckets and spit some values.


All I need is to know if this would be possible at all, and if so, which technologies/libraries should I look for, and I'll to do my homework; not looking for copy&amp;paste comments :)

Thanks!"

Today, every excel I get I create a pivot table to analyze the data, and I sometimes need to compare against multiple revisions. I use mixtures of conditional formatting and vlookups today.

I wanted to see if there is a better way. I would love to just important the excel data into a database and   Export on what I need. It would also be nice to create some visualization such as graphs.

___

**Brief background**

I graduated with a degree in Finance. After which, I held various 'Analyst' roles which involves report generation through in-house systems and analysis of Financial data in Excel. Apart from Vlookups and Pivot Tables in Excel, I had no experience with other programs. 


Last year, I was offered a role in a logistics company. The job requirement was to support analysis of performance and generation of reports. Although this job was in a different view, the general scope was mostly similar to what I did in my previous jobs in the Finance industry.

___

**Move to Data Analytics**


Towards the end of the year, my department announced that there will be a shift in focus towards Data. My team was then grouped under 'Data Analytics'. The department announced that older data systems would be obsolete and newer programs will be used instead. These programs included SAC and Spotfire. I had a discussion with my manager and he encouraged me to take some online courses to better equip myself with the skills during this transition.

___

**Courses and Reading Material**

Below is the list of courses which I am currently going through. As I prefer having to learn various subjects instead of focusing on one, I take these courses concurrently. 




Courses/Material| Comments
---|---
 Basic Statistics by University of Amsterdam (Coursera)| This was recommended by my manager to have a foundation of statistics before proceeding with programming languages. I had briefly covered Statistics in my University and this was a good refresher in cementing my understanding of Statistics
Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes| I enjoy reading this as the material is very beginner friendly. I especially like the 'Practice Questions' at the end of each chapter that tests your knowledge.
Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python (edx)| I intend to finish reading Python Crash Course before starting this. Previously, I had jumped directly into this course and found it too overwhelming for a beginner.
Anki|For reviewing of materials, I have created flashcards through the Anki app which I find to be very helpful in retaining what I have learnt through spatial repetition. 

Are there any other courses, materials you can recommend for beginners who are interested in improving/learning more about data analytics? Thank you for your time!"

The internship I’ll currently be at deals a lot with SAS so I’ve been recommended by former professors to check out LinkedIn Learning to educate myself on the topic. Any other materials I should be looking at? 

Does anybody have any recommendations on how to advance career growth, and salary, in the long term in this field? Are there any specific languages I should be learning or is it better to apply for a graduate program in data analytics to get a more well rounded background? I’ve been looking around and there seem to be a lot that are interesting and have a circumference of specific studies. 

Is there a difference between a graduate program and certificate in terms of career growth? If it's more affordable to get a certificate and end up in the same place then that's clearly the better option. But if a Master's in Data Science or similar field is that step above then I may have to start applying.

I was hoping you could take a quick look at my CV's professional experience section and let me know what you think! I've been working on my CV to make it more analytically-inclined, and I think my previous role (which I emphasize the most) fits the bill pretty well.

I'd like to continue straddling the line between business and data, not dive fully into the data side.

This is a pretty easy question, but let me just say that many years have passed since I took data analysis and statistic at Uni, so forgive me 😂

So, I have 3K sellers and they all started their activity on different dates, starting from September 2019. I want to create a chart to evaluate their performances over a period of 6 months, but I do want to take their ""starting date"" into consideration, so I need to find a way to connect how much they have sold and for how long, then to rate them based on numbers that make sense.

So:
- I can divide

(number of products sold)/(days of activation)

given that the products cost the same. In this case I don't really take into consideration their ""longevity"" though, so I can have two stores with the same results but one has been active for 6 months, the other for 20 days.

Ex:
A: sold (200 units), days since act (100)-&gt; AVG/day= 2
B: sold (10 units), days since act (5)-&gt; AVG/day=2

- I can multiply these results for 182 (days in 6 months, the period I am taking into consideration), but again: not ok, it is a projection. I am not sure if they will actually sell that amount.

So my question is: how would you create the chart? How would you normalize those numbers to discriminate longevity and have a final number that makes sense!?


Sorry for my English, not a native and excuse me for the question: I don't now if I am rusty in math (I have a degree in analitical chemistry, but.... Ahah) or it's the quarantine hysteria.

Data analytics is a science field to analyze raw data to conclude the information. Most of the techniques and data analytics processes have been automated into algorithms and mechanical processes which work on raw data for human use. Data analytics methods can disclose metrics and trends which would contrarily be lost along with large information. Then, this information can be used to optimize the processes to boost the total business or system efficiency.

#### Why is there a need to understand data analytics?

Data analytics is an open term that includes various types of data analysis. Any kind of information is subjected to data analytics methods to receive awareness to improve things. For instance, a manufacturing company regularly records the downtime, work queue and operation time for different machines and the data is then analyzed to plan out the number of workloads for the machines so that the machines can operate to their maximum capacity. Data analytics can perform much more than identifying bottlenecks in the production process. Also, gaming companies use data analytics techniques to set schedules for receiving rewards for players which keeps the majority of players engaged in the game. Likewise, content-driven companies use a lot of data analytics tools for customers that keep them hooked onto the content through clicking, watching and restructuring content to receive another click or view from customers.

#### Significance of data analytics

Data analytics is integral as it helps businesses to enhance their performances by embedding it to the business model. The companies will be able to reduce costs by finding the most efficient manner in doing business and by allowing companies to store a vast amount of data. Also, a company can use data analytics to make decisions that are better for business and help in evaluating customer trends and satisfaction that can result in the production of new and well-equipped products and services.

#### Types of data analytics

Data analytics is branched into four primary types of analytics.

1. **Descriptive analytics**

This type of analytics depicts the events that have happened over a specified period, for example, have the number of views increased and have the sales increased compared to the previous month?

1. **Diagnostic analytics**

This type of analytics has emphasis on the reason for something to happen. This includes many different data inputs and a small part of hypothesizing. For instance, a question on whether the weather affected the sales of beer or did the new marketing campaign have an impact on sales.

1. **Predictive analysis** 

This type of analytics analyzes the likelihood of events happening in the future. For example, the impact of sales due to the hot summer in the previous month or the various types of weather models used to predict the hot summer in the present year.

1. **Prescriptive analytics**

This type of analytics mentions a suitable course of action for predicting events to happen in the future. For instance, if the possibility of a hot summer occurring is measured based on the model showing 58% above the average of different types of weather, then a suitable course of action would be to include an evening timing to the brewery and rent a supplementary tank to improve output.

There were 40 of each soil:species combination, leading to 480 samples altogether.

We were curious in both germination and growth rates, so individuals were grown from seed in the substrates of interest, rather than first growing them in a separate, more-ideal medium. One of the species didn't germinate at all in 2 substrates (with only 1 and 3 germinations in the other 2).

I measured leaf counts, plus length of longest leaf 3 times per week, and measured dry aboveground biomass at the end.

How can I analyze this data? Do I drop that species from larger analysis, run a two-way ANOVA on the remaining two species, and simply report the failings of that other species?"

Hello!

I am currently a junior in undergrad picking out classes for next year. I am interested in pursuing a career in data analytics, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Business with two emphases: Information Management and Business Analytics and a minor in Computer Science.

Recently my adviser reached out to me and said with my overlaps I can obtain an interdisciplinary degree in Business and Computer Science by adding in two more classes. However, I am conflicted because I already have a packed schedule. So if I were to do so I would drop my Business Analytics emphasis (also only need 2 more classes).

However, I do feel like the two classes I need to take in Business Analytics would be relevant in this career field (Decision Analytics and Customer Analytics).

Thus, I was hoping to hear some insights about your opinions as to whether the upgrade from a Computer Science minor to an interdisciplinary degree would be worth the switch in terms of attractiveness to employers? The two additional classes I would have to take for that are Project Management and a CS elective."

For example, when I analyze qualitative data (I did UX Research for a while), once I collect the data though interviews, user testing, and other methods, I first organize the data in spreadsheets and then by using affinity diagramming to find patterns in the data. Then, I will apply the Atomic Analysis method that will enable me to see how common these patterns are and come to initial conclusions to help answer the business question.

I understand that data analyst work mostly with quantitative data. I am not sure how to go about analyzing that data. Any ideas would be great.

As you can guess, most of my coursework has related to math courses, but I have a moderate amount of programming experience with java and mathematica (mostly simple stuff, like creating functions). In addition, I have a decent understand of excel, and its use for analysis (pivot tables, charts, graphs - not an expert by any means). Has anyone enrolled in an online summer program that you found to be beneficial? I am not 100% sure if I want to be a business analyst or a general data analyst, so I think I would rather stick to a more general data analysis program - if you guys think this isn’t smarter, let me know! I plan on graduating this fall 2020, and my internship has been cancelled due to this pandemic going, so I am still looking for relevant education to increase my knowledge and skills of this industry. 

Additionally, if you think it is necessary or have any suggestions as to one, I would possibly consider an online masters in stats or data analytics as well. Following graduation, I want to stay on the northeast coast (NY, PA, NJ area)

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to look at this post! I am looking for advice regarding job search. I have a quantitative marketing PhD &amp; master degree, in total about 7 years' training in business data analytics. I am very good with marketing analytics tools such as Google Analytics, coding (python, r , matlab, spark, SQL etc), visualization tools and modeling (both econometric and machine learning). I am also trained in psychology and digital marketing.  

I am graduating next year and I want to keep doing marketing related data analysis for companies. I want to be able to use what I have learnt instead of just doing reporting. I do not want to stay in academia. So my questions are: 

&amp;#x200B;

(1) what type of job title should I look at? 

(2) Would companies prefer someone with BS degree and years of working experience over me?

(3) Is there any other industry or type of job I should also look at, like working for government?

**How To Make Raw Data Ready For Machine Learning Process**

In this step we will cover :

1. Knowledge about Library we will use to work, manipulate and visualise our data.
2. So important things we have to see or find in data before we can do anything with it.
3. Things which can jeopardise our Data
4. What are the categorical values?
5. Missing and dummy values in data.
6. What are Feature selection and feature scaling?
7. Standardisation and Normalisation
8. Cross-validation Library.
9. How to import the dataset into spyder.

The library we will use to work, manipulate and visualise our data :

For now, we will use three libraries, namely:

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

So, what is **NumPy ?**

&gt;Numpy : Numpy is a library for python programming language for large multidimensional arrays and matrices along with high level of mathematical functions to operate on these array.

To put these in the simple words :

“We use NumPy to do mathematical operations on our data.”

**Numpy = Maths**

But wait for this can only happen when we have the power to manipulate our data, how do we do that – answer is pandas library.

&gt;Pandas: Pandas is a library written in python language to manipulate and analysis. In particular, it offers us to manipulate numeric table and time series.

In simple words: Pandas help us to manipulate data .

**Pandas = Manipulation**

What about Visualisation Part :

&gt;Matplotlib: Matplotlib is the plotting library for pythons programming.

So, **Matplotlib = Visualization**

After we have talked about library lets talk about :

Important things we have to see or find in data before we can do anything with it.

When we get data it is in its Raw form which can jeopardise the result of our model so before we can do anything with data we have to clean that data and extract only important information from our data this step is called “DATA PREPROCESSING”.

Things which can jeopardise our Data

**Categorical values**

&gt;Missing data  
Dummy Variable  
Outliers

* **Categorical values:** Categorical values are values which can be categories and this type of data can cause redundancy.

📷

Catagorical values : 1

📷

Catagorical values : 2

**Missing Value:** When we get data in Raw formate it’s most of the time that data has some missing values. like :

📷

Missing Values

**Dummy Variable Trap:** Condition when which two or more variables are highly correlated.

**Outlier Values:** outlier as those values of the data set that fall far from the central point, the median but have effect in our dataset.

📷

Outlier Values

&gt;**Feature Selection:** Feature selection is used to select those features that contribute most to the prediction variable that we are interested in.

**Benefits of feature selection**

1. Reduce overfitting by making data less redundant.

2. Reduce training time by eliminating misleading data.

3. Improve accuracy by collecting fewer data points.

So now I have a table having individual ID and survival probability by months of participation in a new service. 

The probability is based on gender and other behavior traits like length of membership, monthly expenditures, number of logins etc.

Great! But now what? 

The goal is to predict when members stop using a service based on these other traits - that’s what my model did. And I have that probability score by ID. 

How do I apply this whole thing to my 2020 data??? 

Do I match my survival table by ID with my 2020 table? Then I won’t have the full range of members as many have already left the service...

Or do I match the behavior traits with my 2020 table? Like as in males, who log in 10-15 times a month and spend $200/month are 89% likely to participate 6 month in the service. Vs Women with the same behaviors are 75% likely to participate for 6 month in the service. 

I apologize if those are stupid or obvious questions but I am just so lost on the details of what to do next. I found plenty of info of how to run the survival analysis but nothing on what’s next. Really appreciate any pointers and please use simple language.

Thank you!

Tldr; What’s the next step after you have a model with a probability score - how do I apply the probability score to my target data?"

I started thinking about the statistics of a crime. Where they happen? When they happen? Who is the most common victim?

Now I am not speaking on major crime. I am more interested in minor residential crime. Many times neighborhood crimes such as a stolen package or lawn items being stolen may not even be reported to the police. 

This leads me two questions are the events that are reported to the police station accessible to the public? As in, is there a database on local crime in which a citizen can go analyze?

Secondly, the app neighborhood, many individuals post there on neighborhood activity that is not necessarily alarming enough to report the police. Is there anyway to access the data reported on the app to deduce some type of analysis?

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if this has been done before. Any direction or alternative suggestion for attacking this idea would be appreciated. My reason, with everyone staying home the rise of delivery has increased. Idle time and unemployment also means more crime. Having more of a sense of when these crimes occur and who is vulnerable based on reporting can help, I think. Tight knit communities keep each other safe. In the modern age we aren't as connected or tight knit. If the data is there why not execute on it. If it isn't there, how can we create a platform in the modern age where information is easily passed around on what is happening whether big or small in relation to crime? Whether it comes from the police or from the guy that sits at his front  porch watching the cars go by. Does this make sense? Im sure i left holes somewhere."

I've done an exploratory data analysis on a dataset for the purposes of my BSc thesis and i would really appreciate it if you could help me organise what I've done into sections so that i don't throw everything into a single one.

So, this is briefly what I did:

\-Discrete features:

  Analysed basic stats (quartiles, median, mean, etc) 

  Bar chart for each feature independently  

  Bar chart for each feature along with the depended variable.

\-Continuous features: 

  Analysed basic stats (quartiles, median, mean, etc) 

  Density graph for each feature interdependently 

  Density graph for each feature along with the depended variable.

\-Correlation matrix to find linear relationships between the variables

\-Missing values graph

\-Boxplots to discuss possible outliers 

&amp;#x200B;

Except for the missing values and the outliers, how could I  break into sections the rest of the analysis that i did?

Thanks in advance"

It's designed to be efficient and intuitive. Connect your data, prepare it, and visualize it. You can then save them as templates, or reports. It's also got a ""one-click"" sentiment analysis function and some other neat stuff like drag and drop queries.

If anyone is interested in checking the tool out and providing a little feedback, recommending features you'd like to see or things that just don't work for you, then we're looking for experts in the following sectors/areas:

Finance, Marketing, FMCG, Retail, Ecommerce, Consulting, Insurance. 

If you fall into one of those categories and analyze data as part of your role (or if you're just curious and want to try it out) please drop a comment below and I'll message you with some details.

I will be graduating this year in BA: PR and Advertising. While preparing ad campaigns for uni, the topic of research really grew onto me- I like finding insights(from publicly available reports,articles and analysis) and building promotional campaigns around them. Since then, I started to look more in depth into the data field and how I could become a more valuable asset if I actually knew how to extract data, read it, interpret it and generate insights for companies, or recommend solutions.  Essentially, this is what I want to do. 

I have two very general questions:

1. I understand there are A LOT of different job positions regarding data( Data Analysist, Data Scientist, BIA, Data Engineer etc.) Now, when I read the descriptions of those profiles, to me they all
appear relatively the same. I get confused in who does what, especially when I have 0 experience. IDEALLY, I want to be able to do something that doesn’t require a ton of software knowledge. Is that possible and which area specifically would that be?

2. If there is such a position, how do I actually begin my training. A uni degree wouldn’t be an option right now. I am looking for recommendations for online courses that would be able to give me the enough(minimum) skills I need in order to get to a vary basic, entry-level data job. I see a MUST in data jobs is knowledge of SQL. (Now this might sound VERY dumb, but would understanding of SQL alone would be sufficient in landing an entry-level job?) What other things should I consider?

My real thinking here is not to become a data expert( at least not for now) but to combine those two fields in the perfect blend.

I am sorry if anyone feels offended by my questions. I understand this is such a complex topic, which requires a lot of skills built throughout the years and I don’t want to undermine anyone’s qualifications by “asking” for an easy way around. 

Thank you!"

I am trying to run a mediation using the following variables:  


PTSD (binary variable - outcome)  
Abuse (binary variable - mediator)  
PSAI (3 level categorical variable - predictor) For this variable the important comparison is between level 1 and 3 of the variable, so this could be considered binary  


I am aware of the paramed programme which allows the use of binary mediators. However, I am hoping to deal with missing data in my variables. Paramed will not work with multiple imputation nor will it work with other forms of handling missing data (e.g. method(mlmv)). The following is the model I ran:  


*paramed ptsd, avar(psai) mvar(abuse) a0(1) a1(3) m(1) yreg(logistic) mreg(logistic) bootstrap nointer*

I am also aware of gsem and can run the following model:  


*gsem (ptsd &lt;- psai abuse, family (binomial) link (logit)) (abuse &lt;- psai, family (binomial) link (logit))*

And can handle missing data with this by using  


*mi estimate, cdok*

However I am not sure whether using gsem is an accurate way of handling binary variables in a mediator, and how I would get the breakdown of direct/indirect/total effects from this, as 'estat teffects' will only run with sem, not with gsem.  


If anyone has advice about running a mediation using binary predictors/mediators/outcomes on stata I would really appreciate your input.

[Interesting article on data processed AI writing:](https://robotwritersai.com/2020/04/20/winds-of-change-ai-major-author-of-digital-content/)

AI-driven content creation and marketing programs like NewsCred, Sprinklr and Contently will generate more than 30% of all digital content within the next two years, according to Gartner, a market research firm.

Specifically, the AI tools will increase productivity and make advertising more effective, according to study authors Nicole Greene and Laurel Erickson.

So we have figured out a way to evaluate potential new inventories and compare it against all our existing inventories within the same product line and find the top 10 similar looking products within our store. (So if its a mug, it will only compare against other top 10 similar looking mug designs)

Then, this will pull up the historical quantity and total $ sales yearly for the past 5 years of the 10 products to study the average trend, and the goal is to evaluate if the new product is something we should stock up on (200 units), or not (10-20 units).

Is this a good way of evaluating potential new inventory?

Since we want to do this exercise, how can we do it better?"

I am 27 with a business degree and career history in sales and banking, but I never really fell in love with anything I did until the last year when I discovered data analysis. I am currently working on finishing my MBA with a concentration in Business Analytics and Management, but I have been a little disappointed with the analytics side of the program to be honest. We haven't gone into detail over many things I feel I will need to get a career in data analysis.

I have learned about visualization concepts and we have focused mainly on Tableau and Tableau Prep to learn them. I am also currently learning SPSS, however I'm not certain how prevalent this program is in the real world, as it comes off as kind of ""old school"" but I might be totally off on that.

Are there other programs that may be beneficial? I am lacking in programming knowledge, as my last course was C++ in high school. I want to start learning SQL and/or Python, is there one that I should focus on over the other first? Are there certification programs for those that I could add to a resume, or is simply learning through online videos such as on LinkedIn and YouTube enough? And does anyone have advice for someone who may want to break into this field, especially someone who may have started into it late like I have? Everyone tells me I still have time to change careers, but it feels like I'm so far behind. Thank you in advance for any advice!"

I created this account just to ask the following:

I've been studying data-analysis on my spare time for a while now. Because of the layoff  I've really ramped up the game and studied SQL (free online sources, Udemy course etc). Previously I've studied excel analytics tools, BI analytics (powerbi online sources, Udemy etc) and now I think it would be good time to study azure data warehousing as well. However I am constantly wondering, where should I go on from here and how to connect all of this, how to create something actual where I can implement my knowledge based on endless amounts of examples, practices, mini projects etc.

What I need is to have something where I can connect all of this. As a self-taught and already MSE graduated (from engineering, not data related studies) I don't find any employer who would appreciate my power BI reports or little SQL tables. I wish I could give some real life examples such as (using a data warehouse and sql I got this and this data and here is the report made with BI. I'm not sure if I am clear with this. I looked for MCSA BI reporting certification but noticed it will expire soon and I'm not sure if that is the way to go. I am trying to get myself involved with data related projects at work where I can use something else than excel.

What should I study or do beside the endless amounts of online courses and followthroughs. Adventureworks database or DVDrental can only get you so far... :) Really appreciate any insights that can clarify my head a bit. Pointing out to good project oriented online material is of course very nice aswell. In the future I would like to be at a point where I could put powerBI, SQL and azure to my resume without hesitation."

having a dataset of ~250k rows which contains about 10 attributes + another 10 values, how does one go best about creating interactive dropdown filters? On the top of my page I have ~10 dropdowns. Depending on what the user selects for e.g. the region, all other lists should update similar to how a pivot slicer in an excel spreadsheet works. 

Looping through 250k and creating sets is the first thought I have. The thing is about the performance - if I have to check for every row, if it's values are part of the currently selected filters, I reckon that might lead to some performance bottlenecks.

Doing it in the DB, would be probably faster, but would add latency from communicating with the DB and firing multiple queries to retrieve the possible values for all 10 filters.

Any best practice someone could share who faced something similar? How does Excel manage to do it on the fly and pretty quickly?

I have data on total time per day and total actions per day over a period of days, ex: time = 120 and actions = 45 for Jan 1.

I was wondering what is the best way to average and compare the data. I was just finding the average( tn/an) (example below) for the range of dates and comparing between the groups using a t test with equal variance. However I think another way to calculate average is more appropriate to find the average time per action for each group. My example of why:

&amp;#x200B;

|Day|Time|Action|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|1|
|2|5|5|

The original average I did: average is (5/1+5/5) / 2 = 3 time per action.

However I think I should be using actions as the denominator since I want time per action. So it would be: (5+5) / (1+5) = 10/6 or 1.67 time per action. I feel like the second method is the best way to find the average time per action. However, I want to compare these 2 groups using a test test and I am unsure how to do that and what N should be to accurately test for significant difference, since my data is collected by day and not by individual action.

Any advice is welcome as is tips on how to do this is Excel or stata. Sorry if this is a dumb question lol."

Basically I’m looking for advice on how to set up my project. 

I work at a very small food manufacturing company that mills commodities, specifically wheat. 

We constantly purchase wheat at market price and quote potential customers a finished flour price. Besides the listed price on the CBOT, there’s a basis figure that’s basically the cost about the CBOT plus the freight cost, and also the price of feed. The details don’t matter for this exercise, but there’s basically three figures that affect the price of wheat. There’s some basic arithmetic once you have those three numbers, but really easy otherwise. Unfortunately right now, the process is in a single excel spreadsheet that is well designed for the process but does not tie into the different inputs automatically, rather it is a time consuming updating process. 

Along with being able to quote prices for customers a big part of the job is knowing our wheat position exactly, both what the average price of in house wheat is and how many bushels we have purchased. Obviously this is essential when quoting prices for customers. 

We currently manage these different processes with a number of different Excel spreadsheets. The spreadsheets were designed long ago and sort of work, but are very tedious. The updating process (farmer delivers, customer takes flour, etc.) is very manual and error prone. It also takes a long time to update. We should know our wheat position immediately, but sometimes it takes someone an entire day to update the multiple spreadsheets. 

I’ve taught myself enough Python to replace what work I used to do in Excel with Python. I’ve automated a lot of reporting using Python and am now looking to take the next step to improve the processes above. 

My basic question - is there a place I should get started on for best practices when setting up this project? I do not have much experience with SQL, but would assume that the best way to handle all of different tables that’ll need to be manipulated and queried? Right now, data is in a combination of Excel sheets and CSV files, but I assume SQL is safer and preferred? For example, I’m currently scraping wheat prices and writing them to a CSV once per day. To analyze the data, I’m reading in the CSVs into Pandas to report / manipulate. 

Would really appreciate any insight or links to help me wrap my head around the process? From my review, it sounds like creating the necessary tables in SQL and then using Python to automate the reporting sounds like the best way forward. As the project grows, I’d love to add more to it so want to make sure I’m setting things up with the long view in mind. 

Thanks in advance for any help!"

I enjoy working with data and I've heard it has a good work-life balance. Lately I have been asking myself what I want out of life. Honestly a good work/life balance is a priority to me. I dont want to spend my life climbing the ladder either. In IT there is so much pressure to always be working on the homelab or getting the next cert and it's also the matter of keeping up with tech. We are supposed to passionate about our work and constantly working at it on our own time. To be honest, I am not passionate about IT. At times I almost hate it. Everyone wants to hear that your aiming for the stars, while I just want a 40hr week with a job I can mostly enjoy and is dependable.  


The dream is to live up close or in the mountains and spend my free time doing outdoor stuff and spending time with friends and family. I want to not have to spend time outside of work working on my career for the rest of my life. Sure, tech changes and some time is necessary, but I dont want my career to be my life. I'd prefer to make a little less money and have time to live my life outside of work.   


What is your work life balance like? do you work just 40hours a week?  
Is there pressure to constantly keep up?

Do you have any pointers to relevant literature or techniques, webpages, etc?

Thank you."

I'll be focusing on the age group but the plan was to do an overall scatter plot of the daily cases vs deaths and then do a line of best fit for the deaths to cases. I've managed to successfully do that but as I progress and add more lines, how can I clearly display which line is which apart from changing the color?

Link to the dataset is below. Would I do something like ""data name""-in my case I've shortened it to ""cvd""- and then the row name with a label? So something like ""labels= cvd$DailyDeathsAges 70-89"". Or whatever that column is.

Hopefully this is the correct place to post this sort of question, but if not, I would appreciate suggestions as to where to post :)

Here is my situation: I have some 300+ individual graphs each saved in a separate pdf file. Along the x-axis are months, and along the y-axis are average hours of activity per day. My goal is to see if there is a statistically significant difference between average hours of activity per day before the pandemic lockdown in my area (for the time being, lets say March 15) and after (until May 1). An example of a graph is provided for reference. Notice that only every other month is labeled, but there is clearly a lot of data variation in between. 

My question is essentially this: what would be the best way to convert these images to data that I would be able to run statistical analysis on?

I have previous experience (but have long since forgotten how to use) MatLab, R, and Stata, but I am open to learning/re-learning any program(s) that would be best for this. Time and effort is not a factor here.

My attempt thus far has been as follows:  I found a free program online ( [http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/](http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/)) that automatically traces lines and provides x and y coordinates of graphs in pictures. All i have to do is click to define the low and high values of the x-axis, the low and high values of the y-axis, and the first point of the data line. It can export these points as XML, XLS, TXT, EPS, or DXF files (although I seem to be having a problem when I try to do this-- can elaborate if asked). It can also copy the data to my clipboard, allowing me to paste it into an excel document. Using this program, I took the example graph (which I provided), declared April 1, 2019 as '0', and May 1, 2020 as '26', and it gave me coordinates. I pasted these into excel (second picture provided). However, I am unsure how I would go about re-converting these numbers back into dates (or estimated dates), and creating a document with data from all 300+ graphs which I could then analyze. 

Thank you ahead of time for your help!

I am an MBA student currently getting my emphasis in Info systems management.
I have an undergrad in economics, which I just received last May. I started my MBA program immediately following that. So, you can imagine, I have virtually zero work experience.

I am currently an intern at a large company in their research and data analytics department. My specific role is less ‘data science’ and more ‘data strategy’. Or, in other words, my role looks at how the data fits with the overall strategic vision of the company. I hope that makes sense. 

It is very much a data role with the need for technical skill, but it’s also very much a business management type of role as well. I think it’s perfect for me.


I was wondering, as a student with very little experience in the work force, and as someone who loves the tech-y side of business as well as the management side of business, what is the best data or IT certification for me?

I have noticed many certifications may not be worth much of anything if I haven’t worked for X years or something. For example, CSM. I would love to get SCRUM certified, but I really don’t see how it’s benefitical to me this early on in my career.

Any and all resources/advice is helpful and appreciated. 


Kind Regards

So that part sounds messy. Also..doesn't look like they are doing a technical interview either. Going just based off of my resume."

I'm looking to get better data analysis skills under my belt. 

I have some questions:

1. We used R and STATA in several classes to run regressions, hypothesis test, construct confidence intervals, and visualize data. Is this enough to impress employees with these two softwares, or is there more I should learn with these softwares?

2. I've used excel for an RA job and in class to construct data visualizations, use numerical functions, and clean up files that were made from OCR softwarwe. Is this enough, or should I learn more with excel?

3. I see SQL is a very common requirement. I installed everything, and got some advice on what to learn. How can I market SQL knowledge without ever using it for a class or job? How many hours learning do you think I need to demonstrate that I have an understanding? My friend with a CS degree said he thinks it's doable in 10 hours. Thoughts?

4. I'm gonna be dedicating 10 hours a week indefinitely to learning better data analysis skills - seeing as there are suggestions that I can get SQL down in a week or two, what should I move to next?

5. Is it worth it to do my plan of dedicating 10 hours a week to getting better with data analysis/science, or will employers not take it seriously since I got a BA in Economics and never used what I'm going to learn in class or at work? 

6. Any job boards in addition to the traditional ones, and angel.co to look for work?"

Hi everyone!

So a bit about my background – I have a graduate degree in engineering but currently work in a radically different field. At one point I was intimately familiar with Stata, R, and Matlab as part of my math and statistics courses, but unfortunately I have long since forgotten how to use them! I’m now tasked with analyzing data in a way I’m finding difficult because I don’t remember AT ALL how to use these programs. My point here, is that you can assume I know nothing about these programs, but I have the ability to learn (because I once did!).

I have two questions, but I’ll first explain the situation. I have some three hundred lines, each broken into sets of coordinates. Each line has something like 180 x-values and associated y-values. Each of these is in a separate sheet on excel. Not every line has the same number of coordinates. I have provided an example of some of the coordinates on one sheet for reference (reference #1)

Part 1 of my task is transferring each of the 300 lines from excel into one data complete set in Stata, R, or Matlab (your choice!). My first question is, how do I transfer this set of coordinates to Stata, R, or Matlab in a way that is conducive to being analyzed as I need in part 2? I’m not worried about efficiency as much as I am simplicity. If I have to perform the same action manually to each of the 300 sets to set up one master data set, I will do it. Would it be easier for me to copy and paste each line next to each other (as in reference #2)?

Part 2 of my task is to analyze these data. I will be performing several statistical analyses, but I’d just like help with the code/steps for the first example, and I can try to learn from there. As one specific example, I am interested in comparing the mean y-value of each set of those y-values associated with x &gt;= 22.9 to the mean y-value of those y-values below x = 22.9, and whether this difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.5).

To break this example down for clarity, (as I feel wording can be difficult here) consider a method in two steps. First would be creating two new data sets from these 300 lines, each set with 300 means. One data set includes an average y-value for those y-values associated with x &lt; 22.9. The second data set is composed of the average y-values for every y-value associated with x &gt;= 2.9 in each line. The second step would be running a t-test on those two new sets to see if they are statistically different. What specific steps would I use to find this answer based on your proposed method of how I set up my data set in part one?

Thanks ahead of time! :)

My instinct was that I should find the average of y-values for each patient before and then after the intervention, and then compare the set of before's to each after in a one-tailed, paired t-test. However, I something about this doesn't feel right. Further, when I run t-tests (one tailed, two sample unequal variance) on each individual's before and after numbers, this results in p-values &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 0.05, but when I run the one-tailed paired t-test on the before and after averages (analyzing the group), the p-value \~ 0.11.

My name's Christian, and I'd like to share what we've been building at [OrgStack](https://orgstack.io/).  I'm posting this here as a ""request for feedback"" from the community that we serve.

Poor data quality is a costly problem for many organizations.  Invalid data is responsible for major product/service outages, and it can be very  difficult to pinpoint the root cause of data-related incidents.  This requires a large investment of engineering resources.

OrgStack aims to streamline the process of managing data sources, receiving critical alerts, and tracing incidents to their source.  While building a solution to this problem, we drew inspiration from some of our favorite tools, including NPM, Loggly, and Jenkins.

A few baseline questions:

* Is data validation / data quality currently a problem for you?
* How do you solve it now?
* Which differentiating features would get you to switch?
* What would your ideal solution look like?

Thanks in advance for your feedback.  We really appreciate it!

I got a call from HR basically saying that I got the job and what are my salary requirements. I had been thinking about how if they offered me the job I would only accept if they offered me a lot more money considering I'm walking into something that I'm guessing isn't ideal and possibly a bait and switch. So I told the HR lady 80k salary wise, that is my number. I could tell right away from her that it was a high number. 

So I waited a day for them to call me back and they never did, so I called the HR lady back just to see what the deal was. Basically she said they couldn't offer any higher than 60k (which is less than I make now). So all considered, bullet dodged in my opinion."

I  am currently working on my first scientific publication as main author,  but I have difficulties with choosing the correct statistical analysis  for my data. I would really appreciate if you could help me with my  problem! Here is a short explanation what I am working with:

In  my publication, I evaluate the upstream migration distance and speed of  several fish species (or more correctly of several specimens belonging  to different fish species) in a heavily impacted river. For this purpose  I tagged fish at point  ""A"" with a special transmitter and set up a  detection station at point ""B"". As a result, I obtained data on how many  individuals migrated from point ""A"" to point ""B"" and how long it took  them to get there.

As different  numbers of individuals of the same species migrated upstream in  different times, I have obtained a dataset that looks roughly like this  (following values are in days/km):

Species 1: 1.5; 0.7; 2.5; 2.2; 3.1; 4.1; 9.0; 12.1; 0.3; 1.2;

Species  2: 7.2; 9.1; 2.3; 1.9; 10.0; 2.5; 3.9; 4.0; 4.1; 2.0; 12.0; 14.2; 1.0;  3.2; 9.1; 2.3; 1.9; 10.0; 2.3; 1.9; 10.0; 2.5; 3.9; 4.0; 4.1; 2.0

In  my example, I detected 10 ascending individuals in species 1 and 26 in  species 2. Now I would like to compare these data statistically to see  if the migration time between the two species differ significantly (for  example: I would like to statistically verify, that individuals from  species 1 migrate fasted upstream tham indviduals belonging to species  2). In my attempt,  I started with testing the dataset for normal  distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The result was that the  dataset is not normally distributed, which is why I chose to continue  with non-parametric tests. I applied the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed  rank test to compare the two species. And here comes my problem: I get a  result, but the programm tells me that ""the paired t test, and the  corresponding descriptive statistics, only ""sees"" data where there is a  value in both columns. Your data table has rows with data in one, but  not the other, column. These rows are ignored by this analysis."" It  seems to me, that the test cannot be applied since the number of  individuals in the two species differe, which affects the result.

So  my question is: is the Wilcoxon test the correct test for my dataset,  and if not, could you tell me which statistical test would be more  suitable in such situations, where the datasets to be compared have a  different amount of values?

PS: I did all statistical analysis using GraphPadPrism 8

Thank you very much in advance!

After getting a bit more familiar with HR analyst role through a student job at the university as a student employee. I got my job as a data analyst in the HR domain two months ago.

I find what i learned at university regarding advanced analytics (logistic) regressions, correlation analyses and mediaton/moderation effects are very interesting, but not needed in my current role as a data analyst. This knowledge seems to be more relevant towards data science.

At the moment I mainly do some ad-hoc analyses in excel, still learning the many facets of SAP systems and have taken upon myself a “small” power bi project as I thought this would push myself to learn that as fast as possible, and it is also the goal of our small department to make data as easily accessible as possible to our clients in the business.

However, I find that I am still struggling quite often to figure out how BI works (or at least how to get where i want) and I don’t want to bother my direct colleague as much (we are a team of two) as I also want to prove myself.

Is this common? How did you guys deal with this?"

I have been practicing R in educational settings (K-12) as I work on shifting careers from a secondary math teacher to data analysis and policy (master's in education policy, bachelor's in economics and women's, gender, and sexuality studies). I am also interning at a state department of education, helping transfer and validate data to a new provider, automate data visualization for regular presentations, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to use R Cloud ([rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)) to work remotely and have a single workspace, but their coming shift in pricing will hamstring how useful it is. Besides imposing a time restriction, the 1GB bottle-neck means basic regressions crash the software, and any R notebook that starts getting a little long starts to run into compiling issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Because other cloud alternatives are a bit annoying, confusing, or expensive to set up, I wanted to pitch Shadow Tech as a viable alternative for working on the cloud (I am not an employee or representative). The website is here ([shadow.tech](https://shadow.tech)). For $15, i have had access to a 256GB SSD and decent hardware, especially when compared to other cloud services. I set up R Studio like I would on any other computer, and now I can log into my iPhone and run programs if I felt like it. I can use an old, beat-up Chromebook or a gaming PC and the result is the same, whether it's 5ghz wifi or Ethernet. It's not what it was intended for, but it just handles it so well that I wanted to put this out there. The service is a prototype and work in progress in many ways, but it's reliable enough after 1 month of use to fit my needs.

&amp;#x200B;

I take forever to get projects done given I'm a novice, and even their cheapest plan doesn't have time restrictions or data caps, yet it costs the same as one of the cheapest plans available on R Cloud, a rate exclusive to educators. If you don't have a good machine and find yourself needing better hardware, or just want to have everything in one place that keeps your data backed-up by default, check it out!"

I have a decent python experience with over 1 year of hands-on deep learning and general purpose projects so it is valid to say I'm quite experienced with tensorflow 2.x, keras, numpy, pandas, matplotlib and most of standard python libraries. I'm currently learning c++ for performance needs that cannot be met with python alone. I've been intending to use my background to create a trading system I have not thought of specifics but my general overview of a problem solution might be to create a combination of deep learning models and maybe some reinforcement learning techniques as well(which something I'm currently learning). The question is do you think of a criteria to get best outcomes in terms of prediction accuracy and be able to deliver something that might turn profitable at some point? I have not started working on the project yet but when I read about the topic in kaggle and general machine learning forums, the idea of forex bots/ auto-trading systems is sometimes met with skepticism: some argue it's nearly impossible to create something useful and some others claim that they were successful to create deep learning models (my best guess is RNN/LSTM architectures) with variable accuracy(60-90%). I don't think experimentation will hurt, I mean I can start working something out and figure out the best results for myself but I thought it's a good idea to ask for guidance from those who have similar/better background/experience as/than myself as well as others who might have tried already and hear the feedback first. What do you think?"

I'm quite rusty on my data analysis skills and I need a little help.

I have a 50 question survey to analyze and 30+ participants. The big question I'm exploring is:
in this particular workplace is job satisfaction correlated with any of the other variables, such as opportunity for advancement, or opportunity to socialize with coworkers?""
I know I could use Excel to calculate the correlation between employee satisfaction with each of the other variables one at a time, but there's 49 variables to compare and that would take forever. I'd rather just calculate the r of relationships where know there's something worth calculating. 

Does anyone know of a tool that will take in all my data, let me select variable x, and then determine if there's a relationship with x and any of the other variables? Just as a true or false test for a significant correlation? 

Is there a way to do this with any tools out there or, even better, on Excel..? 

Thank you in advance for any advice!!"

I am wondering how much should I know in order to get an internship as a Data Analyst. I really do not have a perception of the real responsibilities of an intern, and due to that, I don’t know if my knowledge is enough.

I’ve been learning for a few months now via data camp, udemy, and youtube.

In SQL I know how to select and filter rows, aggregate functions, sorting and grouping, joins(inner, outer, cross), set theory clauses(unions, intersect, except), and subqueries (inside where, select and from clauses).

In Phyton I went over: loading, transforming, aggregating, slicing and indexing data in pandas, plotting data with matplotlib, creating different types of plots, Boolean logic, control flow and filtering, loops.

I also took ""Intro Power BI"", ""Data Analysis in Excel"" courses.

Do you guys think that this is enough to finally start applying for internships? I have this anxiety following me, thinking that recruiters will laugh at me during the interview.

I appreciate any info or advice, thanks!"

My grades in Comp Sci, Math and Business are great, and their okay in Stats.

I get to learn and choose any/all Comp Sci courses. The degree lasts 2-2.5 years. I won't learn any stats or math (other than a few lower level courses).

MBA in Analytics. I will learn no Comp Sci courses. Just Stats and Business courses. This is where I'll learn the least, but will arguably have the most prestige/recognition?

All these degrees are offered at A-tier Canadian universities. Im 25 years old, have already completed one degree, and have been working as a data analyst + data scientist for the last 3 years for various marketing departments in Canada. I want to go back to school to:

(a) add some legitimacy to my credentials (right now I just have a Bachelor of Arts). I also feel that in the future as more and more ppl grad from Comp Sci and Data science programs, it'll be harder and harder for me to get a job and/or compete in the job market.

(b) improve my knowledge base. I feel extremely under-qualified and/or out of the loop regarding marketing principles, web technologies, APIs, writing automational scripts in Python and etc. I am hoping formal education could maybe help me. But maybe I'm wrong? Maybe I'm irrationally listening to my anxieties/imposter-syndrome.

(c) continue to work as a data scientist and/or analyst (and/or marketing manager or VP of marketing or VP of Analytics or work on data-related products in a FAANG type company in the future)

Which should I choose? Should I even go back to school or continue to self-learn (how I have done over the past 4 years) or do a bootcamp/certificate program related to data science, python, R, SASS, digital marketing. I hope one/some of you can give me some guidance. Maybe going back to school at my age is a mistake and I've let my imposter syndrome get the better of me. My bosses (past and current ones) have told me that they know how big/effective of a self-learner I am, and that I don't need to go back to school for a proper degree, and that I should just stick to getting certificates/bootcamps (if i'm really keep on upgrading my knowledge).

Im doing a BSci majoring in data sci rn, just finished my very first semester. Maybe its because everythings online but I just don't find CS to be my cup of tea. Right now, im considering either:

1)carry on with my BSci Datasci. The degree is composed of 3 cs course, 3 stats course and one math course each year.

2)Do a stats degree by itself. Ill just need to consider which electives ill be taking 

3)Do a double major - stats and business analytics 

From what I heard, a lot of people are saying that getting a job in the datasci field (such as data analyst), you'll need to have a good understanding of cs and math along with stats, while others are saying stats and analytic skills are important. I just wanna pick a major that will allow me to have an advantage in competing for a job, also would be nice if its versatile so i can work in different fields (business, health, entertainment) if that makes sense.

Anyways, I've been REALLY stressed as my second semester starts soon and I need to sort my things out !! With everything being online I never got to truly explore anything.. Any help would be much much appreciated! would love to hear from people who are working in the field of data science or work as a data analyst !!!!"

I was looking at the online course offerings on [edx.org](https://edx.org/) \- namely the Harvard or IBM one - and was just wondering if people thought they were worthwhile, mainly in terms of helping progress my career in data?

Some background - I have been working in data analysis and the tech start up industry for about 10 years now, but the last 3 or so years I have started to veer out of data and more towards bookkeeping, project management and team management.

My degree was in Sociology, so I don't have any formal ""training"" but had 6 years working in data analyst roles.

I'm looking to do something that could help me get back onto the data career path - i veered away not out of choice but for Visa reasons. While the learning would of course be for my own understanding, I would look to do something that is actually worthwhile on the CV - ie. I do a lot of independent reading/learning, get involved with data projects at work etc.).

I read some stuff that the IBM course was based on their platform so was 'limited' in that regard...

Cheers!

TL;DR - Should i do the online Harvard or IBM Data Science courses as a way to get back into, and progress in, data analytics and science?"

I am currently working on my thesis and struggle a lot about the statistical method I should use... 

To give you some context: I want to analyze how different degrees of comfort might impact the degree of well being of employees when working from home. 

In other words, I consider that people of access to different home office environments, and indeed, different levels of comforts when working from home. My hypothesis is that these varying levels of comforts have varying impacts on the well-being of people. 

I divide comfort into 3 dimensions: Physical, Functional, and Psychological Comforts

Well-Being is divided into 6 dimensions: Optimism, Vitality, Meaning, Belonging, Mindfulness, and Authenticity 

I have already a questionnaire where people were asked to answer questions. There are questions that allow me to assess the level of physical, functional, and psychological comforts, and questions allowing me to assess their level of optimism, vitality, meaning, belonging, mindfulness, and authenticity. 

My goal is:

1) to explore the hypothetical relations between the 3 dimensions of comforts, and the six dimensions of well-being. Typically, we could imagine that high physical comfort might induce a higher degree of vitality, whereas a high psychological comfort might induce a high degree of optimism.

2) to explore the relations that could have the 3 dimensions of comfort between each other: does a higher level of physical comfort induces a higher level of functional comfort for example? 

3) to explore the relations that could have the 6 dimensions of well-being, in the same way than for the 3 dimensions of comfort. 

I am not a student in data analysis and have only a basic background, so my goal would really to do something pretty straight forward and accessible... would you have any suggestions for me??

The steps for each walk-through would be:

1. what we're trying to achieve or optimise towards,
2. the statistical method to apply,
3. the data needed and the structure it needs to be in,
4. the R scripts and libraries to use while noting which variables to replace and parameters to adjust,
5. interpretation of the results.

This wouldn’t be a replacement for an analyst’s subject matter expertise, creativity, business acumen, communication skills or common sense. And it wouldn’t cover data cleaning and formatting or communication (there are already loads of tutorials in these areas).

The idea is that based on what the analyst would want to do, they’d need to source the relevant data, explore it, clean/format it and structure it accordingly before applying the applicable R scripts against it and interpreting and communicating the results.

The reason I’m saying R instead of Python is because I think R has an easier way to implement the statistical methods required to get the results and is more conducive to the end of goal of digital analysts and marketeers. Plus I found it a lot easier to setup and use than Python!

As data analysts we already spend a lot of time on measurement tool configuration, data collection, data cleaning and basic reporting &amp; dashboard building that we barely get time to do deep analysis and curation of the story from the data.

Anyway, the below list is what I have so far:

1. **AB testing &amp; experiments (same period):** using t-test, chi-square, etc. Used to compare the conversion rate or CTR or other key ratio between ad(s), campaign(s) and/or audience(s). This is usually done during the same period to exclude the effects of seasonality. 
2. **AB testing &amp; experiments (different periods):**  Used for identifying if a campaign or some other change has resulted in an increase in conversions or other target results. This is specifically for comparing one period against another period. An example would be to estimate how much of an increase in site visits after running a TV campaign was due to the TV campaign. This is usually asked as “what is the incremental increase in metric X due to event Y”.  The statistical method used is causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models. 
3. **Algorithmic digital attribution:** using Markov Chain/Shapely Values against conversion path data from GA MCF or DCM Attribution. Would be great to be able to use Facebook Advanced Attribution data as well but unfortunately they don’t provide conversion paths.
4. **Forecasting of sales/visits/any metric on a trend line:**  Used to forecast a metric (such as sales/visits/any metric) on a daily, weekly or any periodic trend line. Using Facebook’s Prophet library and ARIMA. Using Monte Carlo forecasting to take into account multiple variables.
5. **Media mix modelling:** using regression and taking into account seasonality and ad stock. Using FB Prophet and others.
6. **Product recommendations:** using collaborative filtering. This can be used to show products in the footer of cart pages for upsell or for email marketing.
7. **Lead scoring:** using logistic regression or others. Used to prioritise which customers to contact as they would have the features most associated with likely customers.
8. **Customer segmentation analysis:** using RFM scoring. Used to send different messages to different segments via email or social advertising.
9. ***Can you think of anything else?....***"

This is the algorithm:

(i) Generate a random number ξ and determine the index j for which P j ≤ ξP 32 ≤

(ii) Sample κ from the distribution κ −1 in the interval (κ \_j , κ \_j+1 ), i.e.,

κ = κ\_ j (κ\_( j+1) /κ\_ j )\^ ξ .

(iii) Generate a new random number ξ. If ξχ max,j &lt; a j + b j κ, deliver κ.

I'm way more interested in work that is focused on one task. Something you can really think through and spend time on. Not this jumping from one thing to the next constantly. It makes my head spin. I prefer getting absorbed into something.

I've really enjoyed the idea of working with data. Ive taught myself some python and SQL and have enjoyed it.

I just wonder if its the type of work where you focus on a few things, or if it's the type of work where your expectated to handle a 100 different things throughout the day.

If that makes sense?

And so the numbers we have aren't very consistent, and while we may see increases in what they're reporting to us, we can't really ascribe that to the portfolio at hand - maybe a larger organization decided to answer that month that never reported previously.

I have a BS in IT and have about 6-8months of help desk experience. I currently live in Raleigh and work tier 1 where I am very much pingen holed into that role. Overtime I could move up into tier 2, but that is not what I want.   


What I want to is to work with data. I specifically have been very interested in data analytics. On my own time I have tried to start studying sql, python, and Excel. However, I got sidetracked for the past month after I started this new job, which has been a little insane. I also tried to rethink whether I could just focus on IT, since that was what I am already in. Tried to convince myself I should just get some IT certs like Netowrk+. But it didnt take me long to feel dissatisfied with the idea completely. So this week I am convinced I want to make the move to data analyst work.   


Now I am not sure what my next move should be. First, I thought maybe I should dive into a masters degree. I mean, if you head over to the data scientist page they would probably tell me that a masters is expected. But, I am talking about a move to data analyst, not straight to data science work. I am not sure I really want to push to data science. I more want a good work life balance over pushing the boundaries of my career for the big bucks.   


Problem with masters is that I am no really wanting the debt and or a full-time program. So I was thinking I could get a cert at college instead. Still looking at debt. There is a local community college that has business analyst courses. I could take classes there and get ""certs"". I am sure it would be a good learning experience, the college has a good reputation.   


But I started apply yesterday and again was wondering if it was really necessary? There is so many online resources. So I didnt.   


It is true that there are tons of opportunity to learn online. Even if it some of it cost money, it is significantly cheaper then even taking classes at a community colleges.   


The problem is that I dont only need to learn excel, python, sql. I need to learn how to think like a data analyst. I am just unsure how I go from where I am to a data analyst job. If more college is not necessary I will need to prove that I am hirable. I am not really expected jobs opportunities to open up until next year, due to the way COVID has impacted the economy. I do know that I will want to make a company jump.   
With all that said, can I get advise? Should I consider college? If not, what should be doing to make myself hirable?

I was thinking that I could focus on Excel first and added in SQL and Python.  But I may want to focus on one or two things at a time at first. I find that if I try to randomly start studying a lot of difference things at once I tend to get a little overwhelmed. Its seems excel may be the first step to get into entry data analyst?  


sorry for the long post. Any feedback or advice would be really appreciated."

I’m currently in a master’s program studying data analysis as I was not exposed to this while in undergrad. I majored in something entirely different. My school is offering me the option to select the standard thesis route or internship route. I’m barely starting out my courses in data analysis, so I figured thesis would be better in the long run because some positions that I’d previously applied for required research. In addition, my school isn’t offering a lot of networking opportunities; it’ll be on my own. It seemed a bit risky because while I am working in some data analysis, it is not specific to the requirements my school is looking for. 

I’m wondering if I made a mistake selecting the thesis route. My advisor is possibly going to offer me the opportunity to work as a research assistant for another faculty, though. 

Since I selected the thesis route instead of a professional one, will that hinder me in the future?"

We  got a ""little"" Data Analysis project instead of an exam and it's all  going well (more or less) but we want to add a small machien learning  part. But we're all out of ideas to how. KNN, Suport Vector Machines,  Decision Trees and KMeans dont seem to fit (or work) for us. (Still  workind on decision trees - seems the most fit one)

So  about our project/DataFrame: we got college (136 colleges to be  precise) on the index and majors (sorted into 8 groups) as columns. We  got statistics about over 500.000 where they are studying and what  major. Now we want to teach the machine to predict where about 100.000  new students will go ( college and major).

Currently we've broken down each creative into 20+ objective characteristics, for example:

* CTA button (Y/N)
* Exclusive discount mentioned (Y/N)
* etc

For each campaign we have two main data points: CTR and conversions.

What's the best way to find patterns from this data? We're looking to find out how each feature affects CTR/conversions.

If this is a much bigger question than I'm making it out to be, does anyone have any good resources to read up on?"

As accounting seems is a dying profession, I want to move to a more data related job if possible.

Is it possible to find a decent job and is it possible I can build a decent profession by doing data analysis without programming language?

Basically it's a lot of different observations (I just copy pasted two) and I want to get rid of all the information inbetween the actual data, as well as get rid of the 'DATA=' at the start of the first column.

My understanding is that the three columns are: Date|Magnitude|Error

There were 3 rounds of interview for this role of IT infrastructure specialist. They now called me again to do one final panel interview. 

Since my interview is coming up, I am looking to read up some articles or watch videos to get my head back on track especially focusing on SAAS solutions, problem solving in SAAS where these solutions are deployed in large enterprise firms:


- Saas solutions troubleshooting and general know how, handling client expectations. 

- AWS provisioned solutions 

- How to reduce cost in saas provisioned solutions, including private and public clouds. 

- Modernization of applications 

- How do clients deal with saas solution providers, reducing costs. 

- Data analytics in saas. 


Its not going to be too technical interview as i already passed it months ago, this inteview is more about if I am the right fit to be working in SAAS field utilizing aws, private cloud in data centers, multiple clients etc. Any resources you can provide, I will be very thankful."

I come from an Accounting background mainly in 2 different sectors:

1. Financial

2. Manufacturing

I've worked in industries banking to plastics, healthcare, agricultural equipment, truck trailer, automotive, etc. All of these business require radically different solutions and have hugely different questions regarding how to provide value to these respective organizations. No 2 companies in the same sector are going to have the same challenges. Just because 2 companies may be in the Energy sector, if one is fossil fuel (coal) and one is nuclear, you are going to have a totally different regulatory and compliance environment, expenses, metrics, etc.

Just about every department loops me into their meetings because management likes having a ""data expert"" in the room who can answer technical questions about using and reporting on the data. They also see the value in having someone who is curious about what goes on behind the scenes after the data is captured. I ask questions in every meeting about the data entry process, what data is important to who, what problems they are trying to solve, and what improvements their team has found so far and then what improvements I might be able to suggest. 

There needs to be a critical understanding of the company by the Analyst in how the company makes money, what its different lines of business are, who its major competitors are (peer group review), what challenges the business is currently facing or might be facing (COVID), and what improvements management thinks they can make to the company as a whole.

There needs to be a sense of curiosity and interest in the business as well. Some of the questions I've asked and had discussions around performing analysis and trying to develop predictive analytics around are:

If our raw material costs at standard for a particular vehicle are $X and we have engineering changes that will change the BoM by $Y x 300,000 vehicles a year because of market demand, but will be equally offset in revenue, how do we explain the change in revenue estimations not only for next year's business plan, but also for our auditors as part of their revenue verification process AND verify the current take rates for that particular part on the model we produce now.

How can we accurately track inventory fluctuations (by part number) for RM, WIP, and FG items by matching them to our monthly production? IE inventory receipts, shop floor transactions and invoices. We also need to reduce inventory on hand by at least $1MM so we also need to identify any unknown obsolete materials we have on hand and track those accordingly so we can reserve appropriately.

We believe that the weights of the resins on our BoM's are off by at least 5%, we think they are too high and by adjusting the resin usage we can lower our standard cost. We need to collect weights, usage, and scrap on a sample of every molded part we make for this particular BoM configuration over the next 1-2 weeks. How can we prove that the changes we are proposing to make to the BoM will actually reduce our material cost at standard in the next 2 quarters and will not be offset as losses in inventory adjustments?

Compared to our competitors we are the lowest performing company in regards to revenue generated in this particular business line. We need to understand what revenue we are generating, where it's coming from, where we have inefficiencies and what we can do to increase revenue in the markets we serve for this particular product. How can we pull together a comprehensive overview by product, region, salesperson, month (last 6 quarters), and any trends associated with those criteria?

These are just a small snippet of some of the business challenges that I've had to work with multiple different departments in the company with to solve. Yes, knowing how to access the data and using SQL to query it and Excel to build pivot tables and pivot charts or power BI to build interactive dashboards with drill-throughs or Python to create SPA's for management to review the KPI's are all important and definitely part of the job, but I just don't see a lot of focus on answering the business questions that management is trying to solve and that I think needs to be a pivotal focus because if I'm interviewing with a company I want management to know that I can add value from day one."

I, Ash have been working as a full-stack programmer and freelancing from the past 7 years.

When I was helping my clients with analyzing raw data. One of the most sought after projects were from people, having large amounts of tabular forms of data, usually excel files and them wanting to visualize it. Maybe for a report or for just their understanding of the trends.

I have always thought that all of this report generation using Graphs and Charts built after analyzing tabular data could be done programmatically as well. But for a fraction of the price of hiring a freelancer

I have gotten paid from $100 to $1000 to carry out this analysis from tabular data to charts and building reports from them. But, I have always thought if a software can do this for my clients, it would charge way less, as it needs lesser time to analyze the same data and builds graphs from them. (As there is repetition of the same process, in code)

Following this, I have developed a tool that allows users to do just that. Automatically convert excel sheets into charts. This is just a demo, and I am here looking for feedback, if users, really find this of any use.

So, feedback welcome. Try to twist and turn as much as possible, so that I could know if putting something like this out in the world would be useful.

Demo link- [https://alpha.poudle.com/demo](https://alpha.poudle.com/demo)

Feel free to let me know, how it goes. Hope something I made, is of use to you. If not, I would love to hear what you would want in an analytics tools instead, so that I can help people like you, by building what you really want

Thanks, Guys!"

Their current database is in the form of excel files which are stored locally. I've been given different files to build models that predict different things and output a pdf file on the findings. For this, I've been converting the data files to csv form and running them through python scripts which I've written. 

My boss wants a local database set up but no one in the company has any tech knowledge and won't use the other features of an RDBMS. At the moment, I think that the most sustainable option for them to run analytics would be to run the python scripts on different csv files (my boss has ensured me the schema doesn't change), this would give them the reports they need and wouldn't require the local database as my concerns are that they may run into a lot of problems using it (as it can get technical and they don't have a data analyst to carry on).

Is this the best way to go about this? Is there a super high-level database that I can incorporate my python scripts directly into? Just need some advice on this as I'm not sure I'm moving in the right direction. Thank you for reading!"

For my thesis, I created a simulation model which simulates the barge shipping process (basically travelling to the port and do a route where terminals are visited so that barges will be handled). I created different scenarios where process improvements were created. I did this in the simulation software Arena. I just used some figures that I found at different sources as parameters. Though I did not use any dataset whatsoever.

Now my supervisor commented that I should do a cross comparison among the scenarios in order to improve the results section (because it will show the (dis)advantage of certain scenarios). Yet, I have no experience with this. Arena provides an output analyzer where I can do a paired T-test or an Anova test on for example the throughput time. But I don't know if this belongs to a cross comparison. The results don't go much further than the mean, standard deviation, minimum &amp; maximum values and averages. So what would be possible with these statistics?

I would really appreciate any of your input."

There are 8 blocks, because i replicated the experiment 8 times. And treatments are 0(control); 100; 130; 160; 200.   


I am using relative height and biomass, thats why the control values are 1 and the treatment values are basically (treatment value/control value).

So I want to compare each treatment to the control. And if im not mistaken i have to use a one-sample ttest because the controls are 1 and the treatment value is normalised to the control.

So if i want to prove that the clone is tolerant by comparing it to its control, do my p-values have to be less than 0,05 or more than 0,05.  ?

One of the biggest reasons I even found an analytics job is because people were willing to invest in me, point me to helpful resources, and give me the certainty I was heading in the right direction.

I wanted to pass along a few tips for how to find people who are willing to invest in you. If you find yourself wanting a mentor, or at least someone who can help you, here are a few suggestions:

* First, leverage LinkedIn by finding 1st and 2nd connections who you think could help you. Craft a thoughtful outreach message that ends with an ask for a twenty minute phone call. For 2nd connections, craft a message you can send to your 1st connection so that mutual connection can make an introduction. For the outreach message, you can use what I wrote:

“Hi \[name\], 

I noticed you’re working as a developer at \[company\] working on back-end client services. Just saw you guys raised a series A-huge congrats to you!

Anyways, I’ve been learning to program myself and have found coding to be enormously fun. I know you’re busy, but your work is exactly the type of work I’d love to do some day. I’d love to learn more. Would you be able to hop on a twenty minute call sometime in the next few weeks?

Thanks and can’t wait to hear back.

\[your name\] ”

* Second, and this is counter intuitive, but double down on your data interests. Put on the hat of exploration and follow every inclination. Talk about data everywhere you go. Tell people who show interest or are willing to listen about your latest data projects. The kind of people you start running into may surprise you. You’ll get to a point where you’re running into experienced data fiends who are willing to help you. 

If you have any questions about my suggestions feel free to reach out!"

Technical skills are important. Python, Tableau, SQL, etc...With so many free resources, the number of learning options can be overwhelming. Worse yet, I think there can be a lot of uncertainty going from learning to nabbing a job in analytics.

As I've considered my own career, I remember struggling a lot with what to do as I was learning tools like Tableau or programming languages like Python. For me, the big goal was always a job. Early on, I didn't feel like I had enough to offer a company. But I overcame that lack of experience and landed an analytics job with zero years of experience. Here are a few recommendations based on what I did:

* Solve real world problems outside of your learning context. So many courses and tutorials are meant to make you feel accomplished. But the way you'll continue to learn is by solving real world problems outside of your learning environment.
* Talk the talk. Okay, you need to be able to follow your talk with results. But a lot of getting a job involves being able to talk about your skills in a format the company is looking for. Otherwise, they won't recognize you possess the skills they're looking for
* Get creative by showcasing your projects. Even if your projects were apart of a tutorial, showcase it. I saw a great way of doing this on a LinkedIn profile the other day. He was enrolled in a coding boot camp, but listed his projects as separate experiences on LinkedIn. Some recruiters will be rigid with only reaching out to people with full-time work experience, but some recruiters just want someone with the skills their company is looking for.

What are your thoughts? Agree/Disagree?"

TLDR; I have been trying to learn data analysis with Python for almost a month having completed Automate the Boring Stuff Udemy course and writing a few scripts but am a bit directionless and overwhelmed by how much I have been learning over the past 4 months since returning to work. My boss has given me a budget of 2-3k to spend to learn data analysis with Python and SQL to allow me to analyse datasets stored in various different databases, how would you recommend I spend it most efficiently and effectively?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Context below;

To set the background to my question, I was furloughed in April by where I work (put on leave while Government paid 80% of my wage for all non-UK redditers), but brought back in May. I work in finance, business lending specifically, as the only analyst employed there, and since I returned, I have had quite a lot of spare time during the working week as we are not lending because of Covid. Since I was brought back, I began learning Python through the Automate the Boring Stuff Udemy course, which took me about 2 months to complete. While I started to write some of my own scripts to automate some mundane stuff I do (I have not got too far on this, 2 scripts started with only 1 finished!), I watched a FreeCodeCamp video on Data Analysis with Python, and was blown away.

I remember watching it thinking this would fundamentally change how the company would operate in being able to analyse quicker, more effectively and deeper than ever before. The business I work at has only Javascript developers for software development, in terms of tech on the analysis side it is still quite old school.

I then shifted my focus onto data analysis rather than automation instead as it seemed more relevant and likely to add value to my job. I have been doing this for almost a month now, and I have got as far as;

\- learning about Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

\- Using a Jupyter notebook to upload a spreadsheet, and analyse a bit of the content with Pandas

I am feeling honestly quite overwhelmed from how much I have been learning in the last 4/5 months and feel a bit directionless, it is feeling like an uphill challenge to spend time to learning rather than doing.

I had not told my boss what I was doing initially as I was not sure how relevant it was to my work and if he would be supportive. I also wanted to learn it at my own speed and it for it to be a more organic process. I decided to tell him when I realised the potential of data analysis using Python. His reaction was a lot better than what I expected; he said he knew what Python did and wanted to actually hire a data analyst/scientist in the future. He then said that if I wanted to learn it, he would give me a budget of around 2-3k with some flexibility to help get me up to speed.

I was boosted by the financial support he was willing to offer, and said I would come back to him if I need any support. I have been learning from free resources throughout and not normally a fan of spending x amount when normally I find there is adequate content online, especially with FreeCodeCamp. However, I feel as though I need a bit of direction and kick up the arse, and know is the perfect time. I'm therefore reaching out to the benevolent community here to see what everybody would recommend!

A bit of context from what I know and have read; I am ideally looking to learn SQL and Python for data analysis of datasets from various different databases, with a view to expanding this into data science as my role ideally develops."

I am constantly frustrated with source data that does not abide by normal practices for data management. My organization tends to encourage business area experts to define their own solutions for storing and editing data, rather than utilizing dedicated data-fluent experts. This is a “cost saving measure.”

Just a few problems I encounters while working on a project last week:

-primary keys that encode business information. When that information changes the key gets changed. Conflicts occur so the same key is often reused for an entirely different datapoint. OR the key remains and that encoded information is rendered invalid. 
-historic data being overwritten or deleted in the master detabase rather than marked historic. To perform a trend-analysis requires access to old snapshots, which are usually not available. 
-Access databases which don’t actually hold data. Instead the data is stored in Excel spreadsheets or other linked databases. Sometimes I don’t have access to the linked locations. 
-mixed data types in Excel (numeric and text in same column). Percentages stored as 0-100% and 0-1 in the same column. 
-Excel sheets where the headers are not in the first row, but named ranges aren’t provided either. 
-Excel sheets where redundant fields aren’t populated for every member of groups. For example a table of employee names in each business unit will only list the unit for the first employee. The user has to assume that subsequent employees are also in that unit. 
-Fields are are renamed at will. 
-Fields with spaces in their names
-Duplication of values into multiple units. For example a field stores a measurement in English units and another field stores the same in Metric units. They may not necessary be synchronized.

....despite these problems I’m almost always able to get my job done in the end thanks in no part to the many powerful data-munging tools! Unfortunately this occupies 60-80% of my time. It also means I have to add large caveats to a lot of my outcomes, since I can never be sure that my interpretation of the data was correct.

Do you also spend more time working around a lack of good data-management practices. than you do actually analyzing data?"

This program is a college certificate in Data Science: It looks IT/Tech heavy compared to the other one - It actually has a detailed course outline in addition to the short summary of the course.

 [https://caps.sheridancollege.ca/products/data-science.aspx](https://caps.sheridancollege.ca/products/data-science.aspx) 

&amp;#x200B;

1- Looking at each one of these programs can you please let me know what sort of jobs each one of these programs are preparing their graduates for - They have a section in their site but we all know they list a bunch of random titles for marketing reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

2- Which one of these 2 programs will prepare me for a more in-demand career?

3- If you had to pick one for yourself, which one would it be and why?

I have three dataframes (X, Y, Z), each containing weather readings on an hourly basis. X contains sensor derived data ('gold-standard' reference), while Y and Z contain model derived data.

I'm just wondering if there are any simple ways of evaluating which is 'better' at predicting X. As in, is Y or Z better at being closest to X. Ideally, this would be on a feature basis. 

So consider AirTemperature, how would I go about assessing which, either Y or Z is closest to X? 

Not sure if this is clear enough, I can add more detail if needed! But I'd really appreciate pointers as I'm not very sure where to start."

I am a 26 year old college undergrad with a bachelor’s in Psychology and I currently work in a customer service job in South Florida. I lost my interest in pursuing a master’s in neuropsych after coming across the subjects of machine learning and data science. I was enamored by the fact that the data science field took what I loved about my undergrad research (data collection, and analyzing tests and trials) and the possibility of training a computer to perform and automate tasks, as well as understand and process large amounts of data to make informed decisions.

**My Goal**

My goal is to break into this field to obtain an entry level position in a data science related field, such as analytics.

**Steps I Have Taken**

Here are the steps I’ve currently taken:

· Starting Back in 2017 I researched the field and learned about MOOCs.

· I took a handful of classes, and learned as much as I could using Udemy, YouTube etc.

· I learned some Python with no prior knowledge about programming.

· Took a class about machine learning, it was a bit too hard to understand but I took what I could from it and enjoyed it.

· Its 2018, I learn more about the field and I also I start looking at job postings and looking at the skills required for data analytics.

· I develop a handful of projects which are reports on things I find on Kaggle and built a portfolio website which can be viewed here: [http://asketez.com/](http://asketez.com/)

· After developing a couple of small projects, I feel confident and start applying to jobs while keeping track of them in a Google Sheet.

After applying to around 150 jobs, I get 0 calls back or responses. I understand I have no experience, or a related degree. But what can I do, to show employer’s that I could be a good entry level employee? I have a portfolio with some projects. Should I create more? Should I intern instead of looking for something entry level? Should I go back to school?

Please advise. Thanks for any assistance."

Most of what I know how to do has been self-taught, or learned on the job from predecessors who were also self-taught.

I still don't feel very confident in my work. I have been wanting to level up enough to be able to get a ""real"" job for a bigger company, but I am not sure how to gain the right skills. I know I am not ready for a job like that because I don't really know the right workflow for tackling projects - I just know a mish-mash of some simple Excel formulas, some basic PowerBI skills, some SQL queries, etc. It's good enough for the super small businesses who know nothing about data, but it's definitely not enough to get me a decent salary. 

I get interviews when companies see on my resume that I have worked with data before, but then I flounder in the interviews because my experience is so limited to the particularities of the small businesses I've worked with (I know NOTHING about enterprise-level datasets, general best practices for handling data, working with a team, etc.), and there are so many gaps in my applied knowledge.

There are so many courses out there, and most of them are for absolute beginners, which I am not. So I have wasted a lot of time re-learning super basic stuff, or learning the how to do random little projects in python that then I never use in real life (e.g., making fake casino games that have to be played in the command line). 

Are there any recommended intermediate/advanced courses that can level up someone with a mish-mash of beginner knowledge to an actual competent analyst? Has anyone taken any comprehensive certifications/courses that go beyond the basics, or that really apply the concepts to real-life business examples? Or - has anyone been in my shoes and successfully leveled themselves up from the small business world to working with bigger companies?

Any advice would be really appreciated! Thanks!"

I work as a restaurant manager, and the POS system that we use boasts top of the line data analysis as a selling point for their product. Internally, their data analysis tools are not too shabby although in honesty not even close to ideal for our operation.


However, what I'm really interested in is comparative data that shows anonymous industry averages for restaurants comparable to ours, specifically in terms of guest satisfaction. The software system has a guest satisfaction questionnaire built in to the cash out processes to help the restaurant gauge different aspects of guest satisfaction. It is a simple thumbs up or thumbs down, followed by a selection of why (ambiance, service, food quality, wait time, other). 


I reached out to a customer service representative to ask for some comparative data to see how our restaurant lines up to other similar restaurants nationwide. I specified that I was looking for anonymous data unattached to specific business information.


The customer service rep told me that this was unrealistic and that she can submit a feature request, but she was pretty confident that it wouldn't be possible  because of privacy restrictions. But I know that the POS company harvests their customers data, it's disclosed in their terms and agreements, so theoretically they have the data, right?


So my questions are:

1) is it unrealistic to expect this type of comparative data analysis?


2)  is this request in violation of privacy issues despite it's anonymity?
 

3) are the technologies required to collect this type of data excessively complicated, or rather realistic?"

I´m by no way an expert so your advice will be greatly appreciatted.

In the first picture you´ll see the original time series. I wanted to use the Box-Jenkins method (ARIMA) so in the second picture you can see how the ACF and PACF is. It is to note that according to a Dickey-Fuller Test, the data was already stationary but because of the really slow sinking of the ACF I decided to differenciate it. That´s what you see in the third and fourth image (ACF and PACF). By that point the only thing I know is that I should use something like (p,1,q) but no more. The graphic seems pretty weird and I don´t recognise the best way for the ARIMA.

So I just differentiated it again  and got the last image. I don´t even know if doing that makes any sense. 

What should I do? Do you guys recognise and ARIMA process there? Please ask any thing you need to make an observation, maybe I wasn´t very precise. 

Thanks in advance!!!"

VBA functions, pivot tables, VLOOKUP, you name it. I felt like I had a good foundation for data analysis, but I wanted to sink my teeth into Python, SQL, and Tableau. 

I noticed so many job descriptions from big tech companies that wanted analysts who could code and automate things. I started to run through Python courses, SQL tutorials, and analysis projects. I ended up landing a data analyst role at a record label and fell even more in love with data analysis.

When I got to the record label I started building data (ETL) pipelines, creating visualizations in Tableau, and conducting in-depth analysis using the pandas library in Python. 

The jump to Python, SQL, and Tableau truly was worth it, but I also don't want to throw any shade at Excel. I used to want to move away from Excel as quickly as possible, but I realized it provided such a solid foundation for what I'm doing now. 

Kind of similar to the manual and automation dynamic. You have to understand the manual process before you can automate. I feel that you have to understand what Excel does before you can understand using Python, SQL, and Tableau together. 

I want to encourage anyone who's currently using Excel and wanting to make the jump into Python, SQL, and Tableau.

It's worth it.

Keep going, keep studying, and you'll move to a point where you're comfortable using Python, SQL, and Tableau over Excel.

Get as much use out of Excel as possible. Maximize your time with it because it will only help your understanding of other technical tools and software later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand this post might elicit a few questions. What do you think? What technical skill do you want most? Agree/Disagree with anything I said? 

Would love to know what you guys think. In the meantime, if you're struggling with learning a technical skill or solve a data analysis problem in any way, would love to be of help. Feel free to comment here or PM me and I'll try and do my best to help!"

For example: we could think of two different users segments entering the same funnel: users coming from paid sources (A) and users coming from organic sources (B). Or, we are showing users one funnel with green buttons (A) and one with red buttons (B).

Either way, I now want to compare the two funnels A and B and conclude which step to improve and focus on in order to improve overall funnel conversion.

The following tables shows the number of users in each step for both funnel A and funnel B.

| Step | Funnel A | Funnel B |
|--------|-------:|-------:|
| 1  | 100  | 100  |
| 2 | 15  | 12  |
| 3 | 9  | 6  |

Conversion rate is 9% in A vs. 6% in B: The difference is -3% percentage points or 33% fewer users converting in B compared to A.

There are two ways I thought about that. But they seem to give contradicting conclusions and now my brain is stuck :/ This should be a very common task for conversion optimizers. So I am pretty sure there is a correct way to thing about it and was hoping someone might point me in the right direction?

__Variante 1: Where does the difference come from?__

* how many % of total users survived each step: #users in step / number of users in Step1

| Step | Funnel A | Funnel B |diff B-A|
|--------|-------:|-------:| -------:|
| 1  | 100%| 100%|  0% |
| 2 | 15 %| 12%| -3% |
| 3 | 9 % | 6 %| - 3% |

100% of the difference comes from step2. In other words: the final difference of -3% is already reached in step 2 and doesn’t change in step3.
* —&gt; Conclusion: I need to look into step 2 (or conversion 1-&gt;2)

__Variante 2: Comparing drop off rates__

* Drop Off for each individual step: #users in stepX - # users in stepX+1 / #users in stepX

| Step | DropOff A | DropOff B | rel. diff|
|--------|-------:|-------:| -------:|
| 1  | -  | -  | - |
| 2 | 85%  | 88%  |  +3.5%|
| 3 | 40%  | 50%  | + 25% |

We lose most users in step 1 -&gt; 2. However only 3.5% more users drop off in step 2 in B compared to A.
In step3 25% more users drop off in B than A.
* —&gt; conclusion: Look into step 3 (or conversion 2-&gt;3).

Can someone help make get unstuck with those seemingly contradicting conclusions?"

First off, I am a long-time lurker and I am posting this in relevant subreddts looking for advice. I am aware this might not be the correct place to post this and hopefully it doesn’t get taken down, I just want to use all my resources for as much advice as possible I really appreciate it.

I recently graduated (23M) with a bachelors In Mathematics and a double minor in economics and statistics with a concentration in Actuarial Sciences/ Data Analytics. I’m not fully sure if it was just me not getting lucky or just not having enough credentials (no Internship experience, maybe not good enough grades, no Actuarial exams passed) but I did not find a job from May until the creation of this post in my field. I recently got an offer to be a Financial Advisor at a good firm which is only paid either fully commission based or half stable half commission. Upon asking family and friends about whether or not I should accept the offer they advised me to take it to learn and gain experience and if down the line I don’t like it I could always leave and do something else. My reservations about this job are as follows:

1. It Requires a lot of interactions with Clients (which I have to basically find by myself) 

2. I have to create a healthy client base or ways to consistently keep finding clients which means some form of advertising or making meetings (which I don’t even know how to even begin doing so) and be extremely diligent in my own business because I’ll get paid based on the amount of work I put in per se. 

3. I have to pass 4 licensing exams in the next 10 weeks to be considered a professional advisor, which I have to pay for (two I pay for and two the company pays for). 

I never imagined I would be put in this position I assumed I would just have to wait a few months of applying and just get something in my field (I want to blame COVID for it). I enjoy working with data and manipulating and analyzing it. I wouldn’t say I’m 100% an introvert as in I can be social if I have to but I imagined myself being somewhat in my own world doing my projects with a small team and simply presenting findings and explaining my projects in a meeting maybe once a month or so, but now my whole salary would be based off of interacting with people and basically selling my services and I don’t know how I feel about that. 

I’m torn between taking this position and basically embarking on a whole different career path then the one I imagined, considering all the studying and examinations (which you have to take yearly to stay in tip to shape) or not taking the offer and putting my efforts, and more of my money into studying for the actuarial exams and trying to pass those. 

Relative Career Experience regarding data Analysis/Actuarial:

· SQL/SAS Entry level experience from school club workshops

· Python Projects(6) shown in my GitHub with hyperlink in resume

· Machine Learning experience from courses in college

· R coding experience also from course in college

· Was treasurer for my actuarial sciences club in college 😊

· Other: Excel, Microsoft Word, Minitab, PowerPoint, Office 

Should I stick with my secure advising financial position or continue with my Actuarial/ Data Analyst path?"

1. Calculated summary stats for each question
2. Identified highest and lowest rated items
3. Examined the items over a 5-year period (for example, x has been in the lowest rated for 5 years in a row)
4. Segmented by demographics (for example, x department is scoring 1 point lower on average than other departments in terms of y)
5. Created a correlation matrix with all the questions (Not too sure what to do with this.

I guess the question of "" how to get into data analysis"" has been asked already extensively but I want to direct it towards my background. I have studied hospitality &amp; tourism management and have worked since in hotels, slowly transitioning from operations (front desk, waiter, bellman) to admin (reservations, a bit of pricing too) now into a beginner revenue management position. I'd love to follow this path while still gaining/combining new skills but I have the feeling that I'm hitting a ceiling here because most jobs like that (e.g. pricing analyst for an airline or hotel chain, web analyst for a online travel agent) require an IT or quantitative background with a hint of hospitality knowledge while I have only hospitality knowledge with little to no IT or quantitative knowledge. 

What I'm looking for know is tips on  how to transition into the role of a data analyst while still using my background to my advantage. Any tips on helpful resources, proven methods, things to aim for, certificates to acquire etc will be much appreciated.

Apart from motivating and generally ""questioning/trying to analyse everything"" mentality I have:

*Decent excel/sheets knowledge (I use the most common formulas, do some minor dashboards and visualisations, can create ugly but working pivot tables)
*However no VBA knowledge (also my last 2 organisations didn't allow them in fear that no one else would understand them)
*Python: newbie, just starting an online course
*SQL: did the boot camp but I don't see how the SQL commands are useful right now. Probably only stay to shine when integrated into a video project or paired with a programming language
*Tableau or PowerBI: no knowledge, just planning on doing the course from Microsoft on power bi (data analyst associate level)
*R: didn't know about it until 2 weeks ago
*Access: very vague memory, did a personal budget tracker and for work a maintenance log some years ago.
*Statistics: I'm trying...
*Cloud services: no knowledge, unless Google drive counts...
*Webdesign: I'm halfway through a JS course, have some faint memories of the foundations of html from school

Side projects:
*Running a local wordpress server for my wife
*Having some apps on docker+rpi3, but struggling with reverse proxying
*Once I get into python I might get into web scraping with scrapy 



Thanks everyone in advance for your advise, comments or the hard cold truth"

Using Excel w/ Real Stats add-in.


I'm playing a marketing game for a class I'm taking and it's not really a part of the class, but I'm trying to do a bit of analytics.  I've been doing fine with other analytics I've been doing such as determining components within various brand of bikes (made up) create a higher judgement/reception of their brand.


However, advertisements for the brands are also judged and I can't seem to get it right.  The original data is in the ""Ad Content"" and is based on the various subjects used in the ads (chosen in the game).  In the game you can choose as little as 1 up to 9 of the options seen in the Ad Contents, and then set their priority 1-9 with 1 being the highest priority 9 being the least priority.  In my dataset I used for the regression I reversed that as I'm using 0 for a baseline for un-used options, so 9 is highest priority and 1 is the least.  The professor mentioned if you put too many you may see a drop in ad judgement due to a 'too busy' ad, so that's in there as well in the last column (a count of non-zeros).


Not looking for anyone to 'do it for me' but any help / advice would be appreciated.  But if anyone could provide me any non-excel examples of the analysis I'd appreciate that too even as just something to compare to."

My main tasks involve:
-	Exporting data in CSV format from an external system via a GUI
-	Taking this data and adding to spreadsheet file to create a make-shift database
-	Use only excel to create forecasts through formulas and summarise into pivot tables
-	(Only recently) Adapted to using Power BI Desktop to import data from CSV (Database) file to create a simple dashboard
-	Using CSV (Database) to create MI and plan projects based on usage/demand for products/services

I would like to either learn Python/R/SQL to better utilize data and resources but our company IT security won’t allow for it because we deal with sensitive data. I will need to learn this in my own time in preparation for another job in another company but feel very overwhelmed and lost with the vast amount of courses from free to ｣10,000+ online universities.

My criteria:
-	I cannot attend physical classes due to my current circumstances (Childcare, travel, time etc.) so online only much prefered
-	I cannot afford to spend more than ｣100pm currently due to financial situation and would prefer free courses but wondering if paid would be better to put on my CV/Resume?
-	I do not have much free time so no more than 30mins/1hr per day (4-7hrs per week)
-	I do not have any prior knowledge of programming other than basic tutorials in HTML/CSS/Python and also currently studying Mathmatics 1 at Khan Academy for free to bring my maths skills up to par before starting a potentially paid course

Very unsure of what to do really to get to the level I would like to be at, I definitely do not feel comfortable moving to another role outside of my current company with my current knowledge as I feel I have had a limited techincal experience and when trying to expand knowledge and use more complex and efficient practices these have been denied by the company.

Any tips, recommendations or advice based on my current situation would be greatly appreciated."

For anyone that is interested in viewing the data [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14QOsDtOOERJIhBFjs8YN6NLydD0ySe9s19SmdGKwPRg/edit?usp=sharing)

**Glossary.**

Columns, left to right.

**Final Dough Temperature**: Temperature of dough after mixing.

**Room Temperature**: Ambient temperature of the 'mixing station'.

**Humidity:** Concentration of water vapor in the air.

**Hydration:** Hydration percentage of the dough. (baker's formula)

**Leaven Percentage:** Percentage of leaven (sourdough starter, biga, levain, natural leaven, etc etc etc...) in the dough.

**Auto Hour:** The time the autolyse was started.

**Bulk Hour:** The time I mix in the leaven and salt. This is also considered the kneading time. I call it the the bulk hour because, imo, this is when the fermentation starts.

**Bench Hour:** The time the dough is 'turned' onto the bench where I begin the scaling and shaping.

**Proof Hour:** The time the dough is finished being shaped.

**Bake Hour:** The time I start loading the oven.

**Finish Finish:** The time the last loaf comes out of the oven.

**Auto Duration:** Duration of the autolyse.

**Bulk Duration:** Duration of the bulk fermentation.

**Bench Duration:** The amount of time I took to scale and shape the loaves.

**Proof Duration:** The duration of the proofing stage.

**Bake Duration:** The time it took to bake all the loaves in the batch. I try to max out at 36 loaves in the oven at one time, space is the limiting factor. My peel can fit 3 loaves on it at one time, while loading the oven.

**Fermentation Duration:** The total time the dough was fermenting.

**Units:** How many loaves in the batch.

**Batch Weight:** Total weight of the batch.

**Bench Time Per Loaf:** The average amount of time it took to scale and shape one loaf.

**Mill Date:** The day the filler flour, Sir Galahad, was milled.

**Age of flour:** How many days it has been since the filler flour was milled.

**Rating:** Supposed to be a rating of the dough on a scale of 1-10. However, i've pretty much said fuck that.

**Notes:** Notes on the batch."

They have been added through different ways: online forms, data migrations, synchronised from external systems, etc. We are doing a lot of work on data cleaning and there is a particular issue that I'm struggling with. What would you do when 2 (or more) **different** contacts have the same email address? 

Email address is a key field and we are currently using to identify possible duplicates and clean the data. But sometimes different Contacts have the same email. Some examples are:

\- Family members  
\- Various members from the same company and they all provide an email like [info@nameofthecompany.com](mailto:info@nameofthecompany.com)  
\- A PA/Secretary would use his/her email address to provide details for other people

Multiple Contacts having the same email address cause issues and I believe leaving these as they are is not an option. What would you do? Many thanks"

Looking for some direction on this project I'm working on. I have survey data and verbatim comments to go with them. What I'm being asked to find is a way is a general ""theme"" for lack of a better term. Something like ""30% of survey comments identified 'website login issues' as the reason for low scores"".

What I've done so far is use a word count to find the most frequently used words and then take the time to read those comments. But I'd rather not spend that time reading comments if there is a way to use ML or something along those lines.

I've looked into some beginner sentiment analysis stuff, but that doesn't seem to be hitting the mark. The sentiment analysis trains an algorithm to determine if a comment is going to be positive or negative based on the training data, but I've already got customer survey scores so that doesn't help me. 

What would you suggest? Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

Hey, I want to eventually one day find out what's top 2 or 3 most worthwhile romcoms. Here's progress so far:

**First is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

* What's best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link below)
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 20 years?
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?

&amp;#x200B;

**step 1 -** i googled 'best romcoms' just to see if anything helpful would come up

* \* this was the most helpful, but i dont know if all of these are actually romcoms or just romance
* \* [https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-romantic-comedies-of-all-time/)

&amp;#x200B;

**step 2** \- from a question i asked previously in one of the sites on reddit (dont rememmber which), i looked at the 4 top 'best' voted comments/suggestions

&amp;#x200B;

**step 3** \- I sorted those 3 by user ratings

&amp;#x200B;

What's a high rating for film?

* Highly rated = 86 aggregated across all main rating sites (users + critics scores)
   * Examples (looking at my film google sheet): inside out, spirited away, boyhood
* Meh = &lt; 81
   * Examples: dunno i don't add those

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**These are movies, but tv is harder** cos there's not really any user ratings sites for tv. For tv i'd use:

* \* [http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25](http://www.showskimmer.com/?t=Married+At+First+Sight+%282014-%29&amp;n=25)
* \* [https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/married-at-first-sight-ratings-53069/)
* \* [https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley](https://tvchart.benmiz.com/silicon%20valley)

but that's only AFTER there are suggestions. I've no idea where these sites get their data from. Prob one of the tv ratings sites I guess

For tv it's a hard search cos I think all of them are lowly rated or something, but am still wondering what's the highest rated one?

&amp;#x200B;

**For tv, msot ppl (like 3..) had recommended ""Love on Spectrum"",** and this is what a users on r/AutisticPride and r/AutisticAdults had to say:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Love on Spectrum *isn't a romcom, it's a documentary series*. Mind you it's a good series, but it's not a romantic comedy (and if people are saying that it is because they were laughing at autistic people in series, then that's a problem).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I am not a fan of parent interviews as shown in Love on Spectrum, because if we are adults who don't need guardians any more, I don't think our parents' perspectives are as important as our own, and don't really merit inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can understand including perspective of guardians and caregivers if this series was about people with intellectual disabilities, because oftentimes people with intellectual disabilities do have higher support needs than autistic people do, and of course there are people with both disabilities too.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I were being interviewed for a series like Love on Spectrum, I would say that I'm an adult with a college degree and not to air interviews with my parents if they are interviewed at all. My perspective matters more than theirs in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Film comment

&gt;Of all RomComs to have ever RomCom'd, ""When Harry Met Sally"" is probably ACME, final form of genre at its height. leads are charming and attractive but not unrealistically so. writing is excellent, performances top notch. It has to be observed carefully, though, because it will suffer a bit from Seinfeld syndrome. It is SO well known, SO much part of culture, that aspects of it look cliche' and overdone, but they're cliche and overdone because THIS FILM POPULARIZED THEM. ""I'll have what she's having"" line is so known and parodied and referenced that it's become its own 'thing' now, but let me tell you, when this was new in theater? That line fucking brought house down. It's hard to think of a better modern example of RomCom.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there's an OLDER one. Possibly one of ORIGINAL Romantic Comedies: Much Ado About Nothing by some unknown English dude named Shakespeare. It's blueprint for every modern romcom. Attractive, but VERY clever people dislike one another. They get involved in a zany plot to help two friends hook up. A villain tries to break things up because he's an ass. Misunderstandings and hilarity ensue. attractive clever people realize their hostility toward each other was masking a deep attraction. Revelations ensue. Ever afters become happy. end. There are others as well: Twelfth Night, Midsummer Night's Dream, Taming of Shrew all contain basic structure and a lot of elements of modern Rom Com.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jump forward a bit and you have Jane Austen: Emma Thompson's 'Sense and Sensibility', any number of versions of 'Pride and Predjudice', 'Emma' (including modern adaptations like 'Clueless!) are all worthy to various degrees.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even more modern, early Judd Apatow comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up are absolutely romantic comedies, just skewed more towards 'dude' direction than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

**I luv this film bot:** [https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile\_bot/](https://www.reddit.com/user/cinephile_bot/)

* cos what it does is it takes the comments ppl put
* And then it makes/shows a chart with the ratings

Problem is these aren't user ratings, they're critic ratings

&amp;#x200B;

**Last is the goal:** The goal is to find what is the highest rated romcom according to user ratings

This is for romcom across all types of media (youtube, film, tv, theatre, everything else)

There's a few things I'm interested in finding out:

* What's best romcom of all time (this seems close to figured out based on the link above)
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 20 years?
* What's most worthwhile romcom of last 10 years?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not able to find what's most worthwhile romcom outside of film + tv mainly cos of how hard it'd be to do so (for many  reasons)"

I might be in the same boat. I got good with Excel and it got me a job as a Data Analyst. I learned Python and that landed me a promotion to 'Client Consultant Analyst'. Here's a snippet of my projects:

* using Python Requests and Fiddler, create multiple bot-like connections to online databases for data pulls and posts via KPI or scraping. 
* Creating Python tool/app for the user to visualize certain portfolio scenarios (they could change some values, hit a button, and see those changes in a tableau dashboard) (Not as much experience here as this particular project got cancelled, but I was close to finishing it)
* Hands-free reporting, from pulling the data with requests, processing in pandas, and emailing to various recipients. 
* Ad-hoc tools, like a PDF reader in Python that grabs all words from a PDF and searches it for certain phrases or words that appear near each other. Another one I scraped data, created an excel file with that data, and uploaded that document to an online db. 

So I'm trying to look for jobs now and 'Client Consultant Analyst' doesn't seem to be a thing. Data Analyst seems to focus less on coding and more on visualization and the actual analyzing part. I feel like I'm a hybrid data engineer/software developer, but I don't know if I have the background to land a job as either. 

I love what I do. Is there a role out there I can look for?"

\- Converting data sources of all kinds into csv's and importing them into the main DB. Lots of format-fixing, error finding and correcting, splitting/combining fields, etc.

\- Updating reports using simple Python and Windows shell scripts. I could never get permission to do crontabs or anything (big bureaucratic companies) so I kicked them off manually every morning.

\- No math - it was either non-numerical data like inventory databases, or simple quantitative data like call center metrics where the concerns where accuracy and availability rather than forecasting or trend analysis, at least as far as I was concerned. I haven't touched statistics since college 20 years ago. 😅

\- Almost no viz - most people wanted the results in tabular format, either as Excel docs or online as Oracle Application Express pages or similar. I have since learned the basics of Tableau and PowerBi but honestly can't get excited about viz.

To summarize what I have learned. 

1. Content based recommendation system requires a lot of knowledge about user and product 
2. Collaborative Filtering will require no knowledge about user or product but there are also 2 different types. 
   1. Memory based - item item similarity 
   2. Model based - matrix factorization 
3. Knowing what metric you would want to use for recommendation system is important

I also found out that Netflix uses a combination model which is really cool.

I realized that it was preparing me more so for an IT job so I changed my major to Data Analytics and Computing and even though I have a basic understanding of Python, I feel like I don't understand anything and I'm terrified that I won't be qualified to get my first job out of college and that I won't be able to support myself due to not knowing what I'm doing. I'm a generally quick learning dude and I'm not technologically challenged at all but I can't get over the fear that I don't know what I'm doing.

I am currently working my way through the O’Reilly book for learning SQL, and using SQLite to practice the concepts in the book. My position does not allow me to create queries in SQL, but I am able to view the code behind the queries I make in PeopleSoft. After learning SQL, I intend to start learning Python, specifically Pandas. 

Is there anything I should be doing? Certificates I should be working toward? I am lost and feeling quite down about my future in the field."

I'm currently a business analyst on a data science team at an advertising tech company. The second question I usually get asked is where I was able to do learn and develop my data analysis skills. I think these are pretty prevalent questions so I thought I'd pass along what I've answered in the past (note: question 2 will probably be much more helpful than question 1):

1) How do you develop your data analysis skills?

I'll rehash a common answer, but then add an underrated/under-discussed answer as well. The common answer is to find an online resource (Data Camp, Coursera, Codecademy, etc...) and complete one or more of those courses. Data analysis skill acquisition certainly begins with exposure to new concepts. At the very least these courses are exposing you to new concepts.

In my opinion, the common answer isn't enough or sufficient. If someone told me to ""just keep completing courses"", I don't think I would have progressed as fast as I have in the last few years. 

My underrated answer is two-fold: find 3-4 associate (2+ years of experience) data/business analysts (or whatever your ideal next stage is) and ask them how they analyze data. This is a real-world look at the the skills the next stage will require.  Early on in my career this was huge. This exercise led me to understand the difference between MySQL and SQL, how much overlap VBA macros had with the coding world, and how you could automate Google Big Query scripts that wrote onto Google Sheets.

The second part of my ""underrated"" answer is to look at LinkedIn job descriptions for jobs you want to move into. If you're trying to get promoted into a more associate role, check out roles that require 2+ years of experience. These postings will help guide your learning process and help you apply the skills you already have. 

2) Where do you develop your data analysis skills?

For me it was in the workplace (my first two roles were a popular record label and, second, an advertising tech company), online (Data Camp, Coursera, and Codecademy), and at in-person meetups (coding meetups via Facebook and  [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com)). 

I cannot emphasize how instrumental my workplaces were in helping me develop my data analysis skills. During my time at the advertising company, I reported directly to a data scientist. She took me through windows functions in SQL, how to pipeline SQL data using Python (ETL), how to conduct in-depth analysis using the pandas library in Python, and how to present key recommendations and insights. 

I know learning can be quite rigorous and the above tips aren't exhaustive, but if you'd like, just want to make myself available and help anyone who might need it. Let me know!"

So I'm trying to enter the world of digital marketing, however I also like the idea of going down the data analytics route but I'm not sure on where I should start in terms of finding work for myself. 

I have a degree in film production and also have a good amount of experience in portrait photography. I also have a background and good understanding in cybersecurity fundamentals but no certs to back it up (gonna retake the comptia cybersec when I have the chance and money)

I have no STEM degree, just a college qual in IT (A*), but I've got the beginners, advanced and individual qualification for google analytics and I'm currently working on getting a certification in SQL and Relational Databases, once I've done this I'm gonna learn more about data visualisation tools, like data studio (just to add to my cv with the rest). I'm also gonna do some studying into google ads and tag manager since I notice a few of the marketing jobs I found ask for google ads xp. I have some fundamental knowledge but I'm guessing I need to know a bit more.

But I'm wondering if there is any advice anyone could give me in terms of what I should do to best get a job in this field? I'm not bothered about starting from the bottom, I just want to get my foot through the door so I can put some experience of digital marketing on my CV and show that I've put what I've learned to use for an employer. 

I'm hoping to potentially become a data analyst or data engineer as a career goal. Any advice anyone can give me is greatly appreciated 😊, I'm new to all of this xD.

I'm a computer science student and I was really interested in my schools DB class so I am doing a research on Twitter sentiment regarding covid 19.

As of now I have finished data collection and I have over 50 million tweets saved on a DB table, downloaded 24/7 over a period of 3 weeks. 
I used python for the Twitter streamer and MySQL to access the DB. And I'm also using python for visualization of the data.

As the research progresses I'm having trouble with data analysis because I am completely new to this and have no idea how to proceed even after reading similar research done.

I have some datasets online that show time series for world covid 19 cases/deaths.

I want to use sentiment to show how the case count factors into tweet sentiments.
I also have geo coordinates and place tags for my tweets so I would like to use them as well.

My ideas on this topic and data analysis are quite basic so idk how to begin my visualization of the relationships.

What are some initial visualizations I can do to show relationships between tweet sentiment and cases?
How can I reduce sample size without losing too much relevant data?
Is it better to have sentiment as a numeric value or just classifications like positive, negative, and neutral?
How can I represent my global data? Is it better to pinpoint each coordinate to a major city/country and rate the average sentiment for the country?

I would really appreciate any help on this as I am completely lost now."

2237,2020-10-16 20:25:57,1602869157.0,dataanalysis,I was useful with almost no experience,jce4qp,EntropicPencil,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/jce4qp/i_was_useful_with_almost_no_experience/,1.0,7.0,0.0,8979.0,"tldr: I Used a three month lockdown to study data analysis, and was able to apply it to my job with the military. 

I work for the military, so this will be a little vague, but maybe someone will read this and see that you don't have to know everything to start doing useful analysis. I also kind of want to brag a little.

I was locked down for three months due to COVID and decided to study data analysis. I signed up for some online training, and downloaded a book on Pandas, and a couple of books on Python.

When I went back to work, I had some free time, so I started doing some ETL stuff. The military unit I work for uses Excel for everything, and I was able to make something useful out of the 15,000+ lines. The information and graphs were included in a report to the commanding general, and will be included in monthly reports from now on. 

I kept at it, and was able to start looking at ways to identify trends in certain activity. I noticed a steep decline in one area, and let the lead intel analyst know. I told him that we would have to explain the trend. He looked into it, and was able to explain the decline. The next day the general asked about that exact thing. Because I had brought it to the analyst's attention, he was able to answer the general's question on the spot. 

The total amount of code is about 1000 lines, and I know that are some huge inefficiencies, but I'm working on it. 

Things I learned:

1- Even though I could do the exercises in the training, when it came time to work on real data, I was almost completely lost. The main thing I got from the training was an understanding of what's possible. I had to go back and look up how to do most things. There was just too much hand-holding in the training. 

2 - It's okay to steal code, but you have to understand what it does. The code to identify trends was taken from stackoverflow, but I had to modify it to do what I needed, and then be able to explain what it was doing before anyone else agreed to at least kind of trust it. 

3 - More on stealing code: I had to understand the code in order to modify it. The code as written did not exactly fit my needs.

4 - This shit is fun.

5 - Don't skip the data munging. The Excel spreadsheets have misspellings, inconsistent spellings, spaces at the end, and missing data. 

6 - It isn't just about the data. I had a little bit of programming experience, but in order to really make something useful, I needed to understand the Python as well. 

7 - This post got a lot longer than I had planned, but I'm celebrating my birthday in a country that may or may not allow alcohol, so I may or may not be drinking illegally.

8 - You're going to run into things you didn't learn from the training. For example, I have to reindex by day, but that doesn't include days where no data was entered. In order to get accurate daily averages, I had to get the min and max dates and create a new index by that first. I had to do some more date stuff before looking at trends. See number 1."

And tips would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I’m a 23-year-old fresh graduate with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a double minor in economics and statistics and I did a concentration in Actuarial sciences/ Data Analytics. I’m trying to get my foot in the door with some kind of junior analyst position or maybe statistician (or anything relevant), I’m trying to get my feet wet and get my first professional job and jumpstart my career but it’s been pretty difficult (mainly because of COVID and no internship experience in undergrad). In terms of staying active while I job search I’m taking a Coursera course for Machine Learning to try to get a professional certificate so that I can add that to my resume. I am also doing data quest for some hands-on projects so that I can see what it’s like to be on the field. I have a resume made out but I really wanted some numbers from people who have been in the same boat, what I mean is:

\-How many job applications should I be relatively pushing out every day or every week?

\-Should I look into a specific sector to try to focus on or kind of just put my eggs in every basket available?

\-I only have one resume, I have heard of maybe having multiple resumes to try to cater to different employers needs, or simply altering a resume to fit the job descriptions better, if this is something I should do should I have multiple resumes ready or just alter the one I have? 

My parents are a bit aggressive about me getting any kind of job just to keep myself busy. I don’t know if that is a feasible option mainly because I want to put all my efforts on trying to land something more sustainable not just a retail job or fast food, and if I do go that route will I have time to both work and learn skills ill need to be a qualified Candidate for an entry level position? so I am a bit hesitant on that part. In terms of relative experience, I have the following:

\-Python projects from Uni (more than entry level more towards intermediate level experience)

\-SQL/SAS (very basic, but doesn’t look hard at all to try to pick it up)

\-Excel (Everyone has this one? No pivot table experience though)

\-Currently learning Octave in AI Course so very basic as well

\-Data Analysis experience only from Uni but over a years’ worth of that 

\-Very basic R from a finance course

I would like to know how to move to a next step or if there is something else I can do besides pushing applications, taking online courses and doing online projects. 

Also, please let me know what I should putting more of my time into based on what is necessary for an entry level position is the python and octave viable? Should I put more effort into SQL/SAS or Tableau (I heard of tableau public and will be checking it out) should I do data science-based projects in Dataquest or data analysis ones, I’ve made an Upwork account to try to get some freelance experience but It seems kind of hard to start of if you have no prior experience to kind of lure employers. I really want to measure myself with someone in my same situation to see where I should be and what I should be doing next, since I can’t really get help from anyone in my family in that regard. And lastly just any kind of advice anyone can give me would go a long way and I would really appreciate it!

Thank you for your time and apologies for the long post!"

But the reservation dates are split up in three columns -&gt; year, month, day. I was able to get the right entries by creating a new  column 'reservation\_date'. 

But, as i added a new row and have to save the result into a new csv, I don't need the column 'reservation\_date' anymore, so I have to drop it. Is there a better way to do this? I mean if i have to do some more analysis, and lets say i have to create 5 additional columns for that, every time before saving the result of the original csv, i have to drop all the analysis columns.

I then use more sql to truncate and insert the matches into a staging table in a sql db. The problem i am having is my match scores are really inconclusive. By that I mean it appears words likes LLC or Inc, stop words I would love to exclude, can trip up fuzzymatcher making a match that should be 90% + show as only 20-30%. The reason I'm using fuzzymatcher is for the speed of that module. My DFs can contain upwards of 100k records. I've tried other fuzzy modules but some have spent upwards of 10 mins or more to run. Unfortunately this doesn't work because we have a ton of other tasks/programs firing off and competing at random times. Any suggestions/thoughts would be much appreciated!!

Oh also, would love the ability to de-dup as an initial step as well! Forgive me if this is a really simple fix but I've just started using python in conjunction with SQL so I'm still very new."

I am experimenting with analysing Twitter data and my end goal is to segment into communities based on the topic of conversation and their position on them.  
I have a collection of tweets that contain either ""Trump"" or ""Biden"", as the upcoming election is the overall topic. My tools so far are Networkx in python and I started with cugraph (RAPIDS) because calculations were starting to take annoyingly long.

So far I build a graph with nodes being users and directed edges symbolise a retweet or a quote.  
I did basic community detection based on the graph with the Louvain algorithm and visualised the graph. I am not stuck as to how to do the segmentation by topic and categorising users into pro and contra positions on those topics.  


I would appreciate any input to how to better build the graph in the first place as well as how to do the topic segmentation. I am still a bit clueless as a somewhat beginner/intermediate.

Recently, finished a very introductory online course on SQL (via Udemy) and downloaded SQL Server Management Studio to do the querying. I will probably also start an into course to Tableau as a lot of the job postings I searched made reference to it.

P.S. The missing data values are Specimens that have an unknown date, and therefore have no value.

If your reading this and are able to answer any of the questions below I would be extremely grateful.  


&amp;#x200B;

1. There are a lot of options, Markov chains appear a lot in the literature, but then again so do Shapley values, bagged logistic regression, multivariate point process, Hidden Markov models, and others. I'm sure it will become clearer with time, but I'm not sure what the best option would be. I need to be able to validate my decision in the report, but currently cant see the wood for the trees! Could anyone provide any insight into the benefits of particular models or the best way to be thinking about things? 
2. When it comes to tuning/ fitting the models to KPIs, would this be done in a machine learning sense where you trained the model with data on KPIs before and after a channel has been added (or had more spent on it), then tested it by having it make a prediction on how much a channel would contribute to a KPI, and comparing its prediction to the actual KPI, and doing that a bunch of times until its predictions were good?
3. Would there be different models for different KPIs?

  
I ultimately want to be able to ask the model will adding X channel have an effect on Y KPI.   


If anyone can provide any useful insight that I haven't explicitly asked about, I would also be very grateful for that.   


Thanks for reading!"

I am a PG student currently Pursuing Masters in Transportation Engineering. I wanted to prepare a binary logistic model for determining the probability of a pedestrian crossing. 

My dependent variable is: Crossing Decision (categorical binary variable)  0=Not cross, 1= Cross

My independent variables are:

1. Age of pedestrian
2. Gender of Pedestrian
3. Preferred waiting Time
4. Visibility Of vehicles
5. Type of vehicle.

All the variables are categorical variables. 

The variable that I am confused about how can I use it is Vehicle type. The vehicle type variable has five vehicle types e.g. Motorcycle, Car etc. Each vehicle type has a binary response that whether a pedestrian will cross against a particular vehicle type or not cross. So how can I use this vehicle type variable as an independent variable as the Pedestrian/ sample  has answered 5 responses for 5 vehicle type. See the figure below

So, as you can see it can have multiple responses, like 0 for one or more than one vehicle and vice versa. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the query remains how can I use vehicle type as an independent variable without duplicating the data of other variable responses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working on a hobby, to get back into programming and math, and am trying to analyze some data for its random noise. What I appear to be looking for is an algorithm for measuring volatility in data that is expected to change over time. I first encountered [market volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp#how-to-calculate-volatility), but that assumes the data should stay completely static, and that a line with non 0 slope is volatile.  


At first I thought, well I can just test the variability relative to a line (or curve) of best fit. But even that is not great, as it does not consider the period/frequency of this variability.  


What I am now thinking is best is measuring the deviance from the 3 point line of best fit around the current data point, so (N-2) lines of best fit where N is number of data points. Am I am the right track with this? Is this the way to go, is there a more efficient method, or things I have missed?"

A friend of mine's family owns a successful, but somewhat small law firm. I talk to him often and told him that I had no where to move in my last job and wasn't getting raises. He told me he could get my a job at his firm with higher starting pay (ended up being about a 6% base pay increase) and more room for growth.

So without much thought I took the job and left my first job as a Marketing Analyst after 3 years. I graduated with a BS in Marketing and a BS in Business Data analytics. I've quickly realized I don't like the environment at the firm or what I'll be doing there. It's mostly book keeping, accounting type work, and random tasks. There's little to no data, or tools to do anything with.

I've been applying to analyst jobs for the past week. I passed a SQL assessment with a pretty big tech company that wants to move to a video interview. I still doubt my skills and ability to an extent. I think I am pretty strong in SQL and working in Excel and SSRS. Where I feel I lack is in statistics. I have a little familiarity with ANOVA, covariance, correlation, and regression from college, but at my last job we used none of that. Most of what we did was create basic reports, aggregations, counts, variances, heat maps with power maps in excel. Part of the reason why may be because we didn't have Tableau, R, or Python (which I had exposure to in college).

How should I approach my situation? Am I overly concerned about something I shouldn't? Are my current skills enough to land something and grow from there? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!"

Working with a company as part of my undergraduate course so may have the chance to test it in the field. 

The initial idea is to find a load of datasets that have clearly added a channel at a certain point in time, with a KPI value throughout the timeline. use some to test, some to train, then deploy the model is a live experiment for a digital marketing agency. 

**Training** 

3 months worth of touch point data (search, ads pixel and cookie data, email campaign, retargeting), with clear KPI e.g. daily sales, then 2 months in the company introduces a new channel e.g. display ads. the model then looks at the volume of sales before and after adding that channel, and comes out with a figure for how much that channel has contributed.

repeat the process for a bunch of data sets, until the model gets a 'feel' for how much a KPI increases when a certain channel is added based on the existing marketing mix, that would be training. 

**Testing** 

Do the same with test data, and make it predict how much of an impact on KPI adding a channel would have, then compare the prediction to the ground data (average lift in KPI after adding channel) 

**Validation**

Once the model is trained it would be able to analyse a dataset that (which could be visualised as a Markov chain), then based on what it knows from training and testing, it can make a suggestion on what channel to introduce or spend more money on. 

if the company took action on the prediction, it would be able to validate/invalidate that prediction.

**Question 1)** Is the above any good? 

**Question 2)** Where can I find large multi touch datasets like this to use? 

 Any help would be super appreciated"

In these last few years, I've built a small scale internal analytics tool at my organization to track user journey, their session durations, and other things. I've also done some introductory analytics courses.
I applied for the business analytics course because I thoroughly enjoy finding a pattern in data, and using that data to make business decisions. The program also has some management courses, so it was a liason between MBA and pure analytics/data science.
The more I research, the more I find that data analysts often complain about being stuck in a job where they're only being asked to do SQL. I don't want to be stuck doing that, so I had a couple of questions:

1. Are the titles of business analyst and data analyst used quite interchangeably?
2. What is it that I have to do in order to help contribute to the business decisions, rather than just be a SQL jockey?
3. What is the career progression like for an analyst? 
4. Are the roles converging into data science now? If so, what is the difference in the analysts and scientists?
5. What does a management role after becoming an analyst look like?

I've been researching for a while and haven't gotten much clarity on what career path to take, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Basically, we have to ask a question, gather data, and answer the question. Simple data analysis stuff. I started looking into data sets to see what I could go with. I found two sets I could use together, they are \[primary candidate favorables\]([https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/presidential-candidate-favorables-2019](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/presidential-candidate-favorables-2019)) and \[primary candidate media mentions\]([https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/media-mentions-2020](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/media-mentions-2020)) divided up between online and cable news mentions. 

What I want to look at is if more mentions in media lead to the polarization of public perception of the candidate. That is, does increased coverage cause higher *very* favorable/unfavorable ratings? I'm not sure exactly how I'd quantify polarization. Would 25% in each very favorable/unfavorable work? 50% combined between the two? I'm not sure about this because 6% very favorable and 44% very unfavorable isn't exactly polarization, but tell me what you think.  

I'd also consider looking at how online media mentions might be influenced by cable news. 

To analyze the data, I'm considering splitting the data into blocks by week, so week 1,2...etc. because the data isn't too friendly with respect to timing. That is because polls aren't dated in the same time mention data is collected. Would that be a good option? 

Would anyone be willing to give some advice on this? It seems too complicated and I feel like when I get into it, the whole project will fall flat."

Im in tech support after getting a IT BS in college and finding the constant expectation to get the next cert and/or work on a homelab tiresome. With all the talk about work-life balance we sure are expected to do alot outside work. And tech moves so fast. I've thought a lot about pursuing data analytics. One of things ive enjoyed the most while in college was learning about data. I've spent time learning about excel, sql, and python. Lately I've been kind of on a spiral of what I want in my career.  


I really just want to make 55-65K and leave work at work. So many jobs demand so much. Im an outdorsy person so staring at a screen all day and then coming home to more of it is just hard.   


enough of that. Its not that I am not willing to work hard, but work-life balance is important to me and I sometimes worry that keeping of with trends will take up a lot of time outside of work throughout my career.   


How are you jobs? do you feel confident about the future or are you worried about competition flooding the market possibly making data analytics a tough field to stay relevant in?"

Recently I've taken over a new project and I'm wanting to do a deep dive into the data I've been able to extract from the database.
 
Essentially the product is a cloud service where users can create and complete daily reports (for compliance reasons) via a mobile app. These reports have different categories and are grouped by organization. 

I've managed to get hold of all the completed report instances from our users (anonymized) from the past two years giving me about 250 thousand data points. 

Now, using excel I've done some surface level analysis grouping them into the most popular categories using pivot tables and displaying in graph format but I'm wondering if anyone slightly more experience here can provide some other routes to give some insights? There is so much data I feel like there must be a lot to learn about how our users are completing their reports and what sort of business they are.

I have the following data: report type, report name, company ID, date completed, member tier (we have 4 different account tiers) and membership start date.

I've watched some interview videos and try my hardest to research these companies, but I feel like I slip up on certain questions. One could be how do you demonstrate your findings to your stakeholders. In my head I just think.. I just show them?. That's just an example, but I feel like I struggle in these interviews.

I'm quite new to cluster analysis and I was trying to perform a hierarchical clustering algorithm on my data to spot some groups in my dataset. Initially, I tried with the k-means, with the kmeans() functions, but the Within cluster sum of squares by cluster that I found with k=4 was very low (around 28%), and also the trying with other little values of k the results were not satisfactory.  
Then I decided to try a hierarchical clustering algorithm.  
So I applied the function hclust() with three different methods and I found that the best linkage to use to split my data points into few groups is the average linkage (my aim was to have few groups to spot):

By observing the dendrogram, I considered the possibility to split my data into 4 clusters, and I plotted using the function fviz\_dend():

I obtained this. How can I interpret this? How can I define what's the ideal number of clusters? How can explore the cluster to understand their specific characteristics? Are there specific R functions to use?  
Moreover, in the case of the k-means algorithm, I have the Within cluster sum of squares that gives me the proportion of variance explained by the clusters rather than all my data points. Instead, what measures are useful in the case of hierarchical clustering?"

In summary - I run a parking systems company. We provide parking stations/payment kiosks/apps/software etc for malls and so on. 

The parking software we use is pretty basic. Poor graphics, and purely raw data reporting. 

Recently many of our customers want ""data analytics"" feature in our software. If we don't provide that, very soon we'll lose them. When I spoke to the customers - they couldn't really describe exactly what they wanted and just repeated buzzwords like ""big data"" or ""analytics"" for the most part. For obvious reasons, we are unable to access the competitor's software to find out what's there.

I've got a tech team, they can make the software, they just need to know what is needed. What ""analytics"" mean. I believe it's about helping the customers make more $ and utilize space with their parking spaces, but I'd like to learn more. 

I was wondering if you data analysts could offer some advice, thanks!"

Another friend works in a big company that has a customer-facing form with a tax classification question... and if the customer guesses wrong, they have to call for clarification.  It only takes ~ 2 minutes to make the correction, but they have to correct on the order of 100,000 entries per year.

Hello guys,

I am working on a data set from kaggle ([https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)) about how student performance relates to some explanatory variables, such as if the school provides lunch, gender etc.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/taq29bhutz161.jpg?width=1074&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5a3ab8d179ba3ac33d251a0747d0091089eb7bc

I have changed all the variables to quantative dummy variables and the variable I am concerned about in this post is educ\_par (education parents). It can take on 6 different values, which refer to:

1. if both parents have a bachelors degree
2. if some went college
3. three if both of them have a masters degree
4. if both have an associates degree
5. highschool
6. if some have a highschool diploma

Now since, I only have dummy variables my teacher suggested me to at least include one quantitative variable. So that I can interpret it better. Here I want to change educ\_par into years of education by parents. However, I run into one main problem here.

Since this is a fake dataset and the variables are not that clear I do not know what values to assign. For example, given the value 5, meaning both parents have a highschool degree, and 6, meaning only some have a highschool degree. In case with 6 I do not know what education the other parent has.Also, imagine both went to highschool, which may mean a total of 12+12= 24years of educatin by both parents, whereas if some went to college, this may mean a 15+0 years of education by both parents, since we do not know what the other parent did. In turn this could mean that assigning values like this having a highschool diploma from both parents affects the grade of their children more than if only one parent has a masters degree.

So my question is how should I quantify this variable? To not run into the problem I am facing above. May I just leave out the cases in which only some parents have a specific degree just to simplify it?

Also how does including a quantitative instead of the dummy variable effect any of my regressions? Or may they just be the same?"

I’ve decided the best way for me to start this transition is to go through an educational track (but not a B.S. or M.A. because ain’t nobody got time for that).

This leaves me with a combination of online tutorials / certification courses / bootcamps. As much as I love the open curriculum content on the internet, I find myself often disappointed or misguided. What I need is a course that will give me a good foundation in Data Analytics and its application, and that employers will recognize.

Here are my constraints for the type of course I am looking for:

1. Part-time or self-paced
2. Duration of fewer than 6 months
3. Reasonably priced
4. Technical practice assignments
5. Optional: Help with job search

My ideal course was [Google Grow Data Analytics](https://grow.google/certificates/), but it isn’t out yet and I don’t want to put my dreams on hold for this course. I’d appreciate any advice or insight!"

I'm definitely not asking for anyone to do the work for me, I have a very basic grasp of R from a datavis class a couple of years ago and I am happy to work away at it, but I just need some advice on underlying principles!) 

I suspect I am way off with what I'm trying to do but if anyone could nudge me in the right direction that would be amazing.

I have a dataframe in R with about 50k observations and 1440 variables that i need to get down to a manageable number in order to train a machine learning model to basically categorize a project as 'successful' or 'unsuccessful' (redacted a bit there but not by much). So I think this is boolean, right? I have added a variable with either 0 or 1 for un/successful.  

So after much reading what I was trying to do was a forward stepwise regression to get the most 'significant' 20 or so variables? I am fighting with R to try to get this working but unsure if I'm heading the right direction. Does the dependent variable need to be something other than a boolean value?

Additionally, the rest of my dataframe has ""1"" for if a variable applies to the observation and leaves the cell blank otherwise, do I need to populate these empty cells with ""0""?

Any help would be much appreciated!"

I'm not a data analyst, but I'm interviewing for a digital marketing role where I was asked to write a very basic SQL query for an interview assignment. And I mean, SUPER basic, where an analyst can do it with a bat of an eyelash.

I've never written a query before, although I've worked with analysts at my previous job (unemployed currently). I desperately need this job and I've spent the weekend watching SQL videos and blogs. Would anyone be willing to give me feedback on my answer? I've finished it, but I'd very much appreciate if an analyst can confirm that it's correct so I can make it past the assignment stage.

   A friend of mine has launched a few COVID19 Testing sites through their clinical practice in a few high-need areas around town. He was told by malpractice insurance agents that he must be able to identify when a patient has successfully accessed their test results, and has recruited my help to try and find out how to make that happen since i'm supposedly the tech 'savvy' friend. Im having trouble figuring out how to go about doing this and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions, ill explain further below:

The current method of delivering test results to patients is by emailing them an encrypted PDF with a pre-generated password pertaining to the patients personal identification information. For example the password for someone may be DOB, last name, test date -

&gt; MMDDYYY\[LASTNAME\]MMDDYYY. 

My suggestion to fix this was to send some sort of trackable download link, requiring a password in order to download the file. Then somehow find a way to obtain the information on whether or not they successfully downloaded that file - implying that they successfully entered their password and accessed their test results. 

That last part is what I'm struggling with, i was wondering if anyone has any better solution on how to solve this, or a preferably pre-existing software or service that will help me accomplish this.

What is the best solution for this? 

Currently I'm using Power Query of excel to do all this. But excel is not a scalable solution for two reasons:
1) As datasets get bigger, the refreshes take longer and longer as the incremental refresh system is lacking in excel.
2) I want to ideally deploy this system on a automated server somewhere and excel only works on windows. Any scripts that try to automate excel are necessarily sticky and buggy.

At the moment I am thinking of a github like contribution plot for the dates and only plain bar diagrams, which is pretty boring if I do only those. 

What I have been logged: 

\- date 

\- what i did (like running, calisthenics, in the gymn ... ) 

\- what exercises I did 

\- how many sets and reps per set. 

\- where i did the workout 

\- how long the workout was 

&amp;#x200B;

I can think of charts like: average number of reps per set of some kind of exercise, or total amount of times I did a specific exercise. The total number of reps, km, time. The frequency of individual weekdays. But somehow the only plot I can think of is a bar diagram, and maybe pie charts ( but I dont really like them)

First of all, thanks for reading, second I would appreciate your input on what would be interesting to see / show and with what kind of diagram,  maybe even something I could log for my future workouts and adjust accordingly?"

I originally wanted to go to graduate school for community planning, but I decided against that. My favorite political science classes were the two 'research methods' classes I took, where we learned and extensively used the program 'r' to analyze political datasets(polling data mostly). I got As in both of these classes and my professor(who does lots of academic and technical work with r) told me that he thought I had a natural talent for it. I also worked for my university's government/economic outreach program doing lighter data analysis with Excel. I got really into both of these experiences, and want to get into that kind of work long term.I have spent a good amount of my free time reading up on and practicing SQL(playing around with political stuff with it as those are the data sets I am used to from r) for the last couple of months.

I am wondering how difficult it would be in my situation to get hired in an entry-level data analysis/science position, and what I can do to make myself more marketable in the field. I live in a rural area with very few jobs, but I am willing to move just about anywhere in the United States if I could find a job doing this.

# Data Analysis' Best of 2020

Like many other subreddits that are winding up 2020, /r/dataanalysis will be participating in [Reddit's **Best of 2020** event](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2020/). And now that 2020 is on the verge of being history, we are looking for you to nominate the best submissions and comments made throughout the year. 

# Added Motivation

A lot of these ""Best of"" contests have relatively low participation. So to ensure that doesn't happen here, we're adding an extra element:

* Those who offer nominations will themselves be included in a draw for additional Reddit award prizes. 
* For each nomination a user offers, up to a maximum of 10 (you can of course nominate more!), that user's name will be included as an entry in the draw. 

There will be more than 1 award to be distributed, provided that we have at least 50 entries.

# Categories

Since lots of members just comment, there are some categories which are exclusive for comments, others are exlusive for post, and some apply to both comments and posts.

* Best Career Question (Post)
* Best Technical Question (Post)
* Best Guide / How-To (Either)
* Best Technical Answer (Comment)
* Best Career Advice (Comment)
* Best Career Advice (Post)
* Best Data Visualization (Either)
* Best Resource (Either)
* Funniest (Either)

# Voting Method

* The thread here is where you nominate. Each of the comments below is a category. 
* For each submission you want to nominate, 
  1. Reply to the top level comment under the relevant category with a direct link to the post
  2. Include the username of the nominee  
  3. Give a 1 or 2 point explanation of why you want to nominate that one, *for that category*, e.g. ""Great explanation of how SQL works!""
* To vote on the best nomination for each category, simply upvote the nomination comments you believe most deserving! No downvoting, please.
* If the nomination does not fit the category, it may be removed in accordance with mod judgement.

# Deadline

* Submissions &amp; voting need to be complete by January 9, 23:59 PST. 


# Other Rules

* The post or comment must have been made in 2020 (the 366 days since preceeding this post!) and not edited after the time of this post.
* You can nominate posts by anyone but yourself.
* If you nominate multiple posts by others (and you should!!), you shouldn't nominate the same redditor more than once.
* Every nomination must not be in violation of Reddit's rules nor /r/dataanalysis' rules (see sidebar)
* Comments cannot be nominated for multiple qualifying categories.
* Comments by anyone who participated as a Mod here during 2020 is ineligible to participate.
* At genuine least 5 nominations, by 5 separate users are needed in a category in order for that category to be eligible. 
* If the top 2 to 3 nominations within a category have scores within 20% of the maximum, the prize may be split or selected from the top 2 to 3 at random.
* Don't make a duplicate nomination. 
* Finally, there will be an announcement thread for the winners. The winners need to reply in that thread *before the end of January 2021* in order to receive a prize.

The next day its a different weapon getting priority. The devs claim is fully random but no one I talk to believes that. Not sure what their reason would be for having it not truly random. Possibly to let people get a lot of practice with a certain gun before cycling, ie forcing 'mastery' to a degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a dataset of 150 games and the weapons I spawn with in each game. I can slowly gather more data manually but 150 is the most that is recorded by the game. I can also look at other players stats, ie I can only look at 150 of my own games but I can also look at the 150 most recent games from all my friends, random players, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas for how to prove my theory that the weapon spawns arent fully random? 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know anything really about data analysis. Im thinking something along the lines of writing each weapon/game down and then writing the next weapon/game. If its truly random it should average out to each weapon being a 1/10 chance to be followed by the same weapon. If its not truly random a pattern should emerge, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Another idea is maybe I could write the weapon for 1 game and then also the next 5 (or 10,15,20 games) out and see if the likelihood of something repeating is higher? How would I choose the number of games to monitor this? This is all quite murky in my head and I would greatly appreciate some help fleshing it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not 100% certain im correct. I just want to put it to rest one way or another. Would appreciate any suggestions, any necessary reading, any graph/chart suggestions, etc."

So, I really need some help/advice/suggestion on what I can learn/make/post, etc. So here's some bg for you (and me) to understand the situation. (Also, be warned - ESL)

I graduated May 2020 with BSBA (basically, bs in ba) in Big Data and Business Analytics, Summa Cum Laude and all, but tbh I only learned the very basics and those didn't prep me for work nor did they stick with me much. So, eventually, I came home, found a job in social networks and mass media monitoring. It was meant to be an analytics job but right now all I do is manually create daily reports for the clients, handpicking the messages and copypasting the info into Word, using a monitoring tool that does analysis and visualization for me. It's doable but its inefficiency and irrelevance are slowly driving me mad...

About my skills. I'd say I have a strong basics of SQL (ms server, access), R (R studio), Python (Jupyter notebooks). I'm familiar with Tableau, Stata, p good with spreadsheets. 
I don't think I have a strong conceptual understanding of BD analytics whatsoever. I can do basic data cleaning, statistical stuff from econometrics and predictive analysis, everything in R and Stata. Database management in sql, visualization in Tableau and Excel. 
So, my first question is, how can I potentially apply my skills to the ""social networks and mass media monitoring and analytics"", assuming I'll develop said skills?
Also, all this aside, I want to... Do many things, really. Stuff my github, make a cv-portfolio, make a switch to Data Science, continue learning CS (css, c++, html, Javascript, etc.) and try getting into web development, app development, robotics (yall, it's definitely a stretch but a person can dream, haha, but let's pretend I put a period after DS).

So, yeah, if anyone has any practical ideas on one of those things, or how/where to begin, needs any more info (on my skills, on the job, career goals, etc) to give a helluva good advice, please do tell🌱
Any project suggestions for github stuffing and practice are appreciated (Kaggle or otherwise, as long as it's challenging aka not boring ahaha) 


P. S. I have so many potential endgoals for my career, it hurts. But it's definitely gonna be towards humanitarian, charitable, climate action cause. (any ideas on how to apply data analytics/science/cs to this?) 
P. P. S. Senior year and half a year afterwards were so underwhelming, I might have caught a depression, so I'm asking for sincerity with downscaled roughness bc my heart won't handle the truth and i'm in denial of what a noob I truly am. 


Anywaaaays,
Thanks and Happy New Year, everyone!"

Back in July I landed a job as a ""Data Analyst &amp; Web Specialist"" at a local financial intuition, when I first started there were some red flags, but I was hopeful that I'd be able to make things work out. 6 months later, I now feel completely burnt out and hopeless. I feel like I'm failing.

The problems are almost too innumerable to list. So I'll try and keep this short. I don't feel like I'm given enough time to complete my projects, my boss gives me old financial/marketing reports and just tells me to update them and verify accuracy. My predecessors (3 in the last 2 years) left behind some notes and instruction, but it's pretty vague and I keep finding inconsistencies and errors in their methodology. Problem is I barely meet my deadlines (usually I get about a week to analyze the old reports and update them), that might be enough time, except I keep getting busy work thrown at me. Lots of little side jobs, like updating the company website and other various tasks.

In the last month I've noticed that two of my previous reports have pretty major errors, I told my boss that the numbers are off and she's not happy with me. I feel like if I had more time I could do better. But when I take any extra time for anything my boss gets mad (once I was berated for working like 10 minutes of overtime in a pay period, or just the other day she asked me to update a page on our website ASAP;  I was working on a report and made the mistake of trying to finish what I was in the middle of, not even an hour later she texted me wondering what I was doing and why the page hadn't been updated yet. I realize that not all the blame is on my boss, I am a part of this. For some reason I feel like she has zero understanding of anything I say and I spend way too much time trying to explain things. I just don't know if I can take another 6 months, but jobs aren't exactly in abundance right now and I feel trapped.

Sorry for the rant, I hope everyone has a happy new year!"

My question is how can I do this in the easiest way?  I've read a lot of things about Python and R, but I don't get it. Mind you, I have zero skills in this area. I have now scraped tweets through the MAXQDA program, but that is only possible for the last 7 days through the Twitter API and I only manage to scrape for 1 day, because my laptop cannot handle it.  Is it possible, for example, to scrape #MeToo tweets from 01-01-2019 to 01-01-2020? With that dataset, I have to do an analysis where I can show that #MeToo is often used for something other than what it was intended for - namely sharing sexual abuse stories or information about this movement. I have figured out that a Sentiment Analysis will not work, because it only indicates whether it is a positive, neutral or negative tweet. Is there another tool or way to automatically generate which tweets use #MeToo, but have nothing to do with this movement at all?

I hope I have been able to express what I am trying to research. There is so much available, but so little what I can do with no skills at all. I hope someone can help me out."

I wanted to let people know about a program called COOP that’s a non profit program to get your foot in the door for data analytics or digital marketing (they also have tech sales in specific regions).


They have big sponsors such as Google, Microsoft and also a lot of partnerships to help their apprentices along their job journey. 


The requirements of the program includes:
-bachelor in any field
-underemployed(&lt;48k usd I believe) or unemployed 

I did the program myself out of college and it’s gotten me where I am today as an analyst. The community is also great and everyone is so eager and friendly to help one another.


The link is coopcareers.org if you want to check it out. Also feel free to message me if you have any questions about the program!"

I am currently conducting my final year dissertation which is looking at the efficacy of common police lineup practices. However, before I launch my study, I have put out a control study which is assessing whether any of the photos I have selected for the lineup are incongruous for any reason, or if my target photos are more salient or conspicuous than the others. Essentially I am seeing if any of the photos I selected will be picked more and may need digitally altered. 

In this study, participants viewed the same lineups as will be in the final study; 8 lineups in total, with 6 photos per lineup (half of which had the 'suspect' present). Participants were asked to indicate whether any of the individuals within the lineups stood out for ANY reason, such as the quality of the photo compared to the others, the background of the photos or any other reason. If they selected a lineup member, they were then asked to provide a few words as to why. 

Looking at the results, I can see by tallying up responses that they are not being selected at a higher rate than the others, however, I want to prove this statistucally. What method of data analysis/statistical test should I use when reporting results?

Obviously since I got the interview I've been brushing up on my sql knowledge, but since there was no phone interview/screenings I'm just nervous that I'm gonna be thrown into a technical interview and be unprepared and in over my head.

Thanks,"

I'm confident in working with Google Analytics and Google Data Studio, I know how to set up social media campaigns and I've studied a lot of marketing theory, I'm also experienced in developing specific strategies and funnels - but am I ready for focusing on data analysis? and what skills will it actually take?

My new position will require to report and analyze our campaigns performance and look for potential optimizations based on which we will create new campaigns. I ll be responsible for delivering the input. I ll also be responsible for ensuring the quality of data (e.g. by tracking, AB-Testings) and identifying new chances.

The reason I'm hesitating is: the things I mentioned above.. aren't these actually tasks of a performance marketeer or digital marketeer? or isn't this at least what's being expected of you to deliver if you're doing your job right? 

I'm wondering if they're trying to sell the stuff others don't like to do (reportings) or don't have the time to do (reportings)  as a 'great chance'. Tbh, in the past I did all by myself. I developed and executed campaigns, I've reported them and I delivered strategies based on data. I'm just wondering why anyone else wouldn't follow these steps through and hire someone just to do the unpleasant, dry tasks? my boss told me she needed someone that has a data mindset combined with marketing knowledge, which doesn't seem to be that common. I can't believe this is true as like I said before: it's something I would absolutely expect of a digital marketeer being capable of.. or are my expectations too high"

I found something that looks like it gives a good output, which is the Causal Impact package within R.

Currently I'm writing my master thesis were I will be analysing over 600 video's of penalty kicks in football/soccer. However, i'm expecting some trouble with creating my dataset and was wondering if any of you have tips. 

Here is what i will do for each penalty 

For every penalty I will be making a timeline where i note the moment of certain events relative to the moment the penalty taker makes ball-contact, note penalty outcome, ball location, and i will score the penalty taker on 3 items (1 categorical 2 on a continuous Likertscale, these scores will be put into a formula). 

The trouble that I expect will originate from the timeline and the Likertscale. I'm looking for software that will allow me to implement a Likert Scale and a create a timeline for each penalty. 

The way i'm planning to do it now is just to directly work in SPSS to create the dataset and for the Likertscale use a digital version and then fill it in myself. However, this seems a bit cumbersome."

I'm a marketer, and I'm wondering what is the correct/clean way of conducting LTV analysis between two audiences.

Over simplified context: I'm launching a lead generation program, where I'm trying to acquire leads within our weightlifting audience and collect their email address before they sign up for a subscription. This way, I can nurture and convert them through an email series before they actually sign up for a subscription on the site. My hypothesis is these leads' LTV will be higher than the LTV of our current weightlifting audience.

How can I cleanly compare LTV of the leads who are nurtured and converted through this lead gen program to LTV of users who don't go through the lead gen program? Is it as simple as comparing these leads' LTV to our current audience's LTV, or do we have to keep in mind other variables (ex: registration date)?

Thanks."

You don’t know how to make better decisions.

Solution

Data as a Service (DaaS) bridges the gap between your predictions and reality. The lower your spread, the better your decisions.

Data is a means to an end, if consumed as a product. However, insights are closer to the ""job to be done"", if consumed as a service. In this article I'll cover aspects of both.

In competitive environments, the more data is shared, the less valuable it becomes. For example, shared lead lists for marketers have low close rates, publicly shared transactions are already priced in to the value of stocks. However, in cooperative environments, like public health, data sharing is extremely valuable. Consider the case of covid at the moment. Keep this distinction in mind for the rest of the article.

Motivation

So what is powering DaaS? Very few companies had the ability to make use of raw data in the past. An order of magnitude more companies are buying data today than did 5 years ago. That's because a good engineer with a tool like Snowflake can be as productive as a great engineer 5 years ago.

We are seeing a commoditisation of data-warehousing with Snowflake, data lakes with AWS S3, and even Lakehouses with Databricks. The end user has ease of data ingestion with Fivetran, aggregation and monitoring with dbt.

These solutions are driving a rise to the market of alternative data, where companies are not only interested in internal (private) data sources but also external (public) data sources.

One example is hedge funds. Less than 3 years ago, just ten hedge funds were buying alternative data. Today there are 500-700 funds currently making investments to ingest large amounts of data.

Data as a Product (DaaP) vs Data as a Service (DaaS)

It is the difference between providing ""data"" and providing ""insights""

There are two broad mandates (I'm being overly simplistic on purpose) that data teams are formed with:

Provide data to a company
Provide insights to a company

In a DaaS model, the data team partners with stakeholder groups to tackle specific problems using data. Team members have more functional experience, and are responsible for providing insights as opposed to raw data.

Challenge

There are hundreds of companies that sell software and tools (traditional SaaS) to data scientists and machine learning teams. But there aren't many that specialise in selling data to teams that require it, in whatever shape or form (DaaP or DaaS).

Being a data-only business is less exciting because data is a supporting role.

Data companies support the true innovators.

It's like selling high quality butter to pastry chefs. The end consumer of the pastry may not even know there is butter in it, but the chef knows how important the ingredient was. Of course, the most important player in making a tasty pastry is the chef. A data company is just one of the important ingredients that goes into its creation.

Prediction

The last 15 years have been about how companies get insights from their own data -- Tableau, PowerBI, Snowflake, Palantir have played into that trend.

Companies that are far along the curve of getting insights from their own data need external data if they want to continue getting value from their data teams. Because even the largest companies only knows about 0.1% of the world from their internal data alone.

Nonetheless, there are still very few data buyers today. Most companies want applications (answers), not data (collection of facts). The only reason to start a data business today is if you believe the number of data buyers will go up an order of magnitude in the next five to ten years.

It's a great time to build a pure-play DaaS business if you’re bullish on this trend.

Selling intelligent data to teams is starting to be a big business."

1. One of our analyses revealed that 30% of the new users ordering for the first time from popular brands (such as McDonald's/BurgerKing) never placed a second order on our platform.

At a first glance, this seems rather high and we want to do a second analysis to better understand these users. To give a direction for the new analysis, we would need to start by compiling a list of assumptions about these users.

1. Could you think about 1-2 assumptions you would like to focus on?
2. What kind of data would you look at in order to test these assumptions?

* Don’t worry too much about which data we have/don’t have about the user, for the moment feel free to think about any possible assumptions.

The management team wants to accelerate the conversion of customers who placed an order only on food to new verticals recently launched: grocery &amp; ON-mart (online-owned grocery shops).

1. What approach would you suggest considering that there is a small portion of customers who have converted already from food to new verticals?
2. Please suggest a way you could provide a set of insights to our CRM team for setting up new experiments that can validate your approach?

One of our brands, BRANDY, was recently merged to be part of our company. This required a migration for part of the BRANDY existing customer base onto the new platform. Management would like to get a view on how customer behaviour evolved after the migration.

Hope you're doing good as you read this. I am new to STATA and seem to be stuck in some details. The data set I am using is the the US data files from the [NBER Natality Data](https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data) for the years 2017 and 2018. My main concerns are:

1. How do I create unique IDs for all the observations and then merge the data sets for the two years into one master file with all observations uniquely identified?
2. How do I create a summary statistics table with sample sizes mentioned at the top and means and proportions to **three decimal points** variables including: ***birthweight &lt; 2500*** (0: no, 1: yes); ***Race*** (non-Hispanic black: 0: no, 1: yes; non-Hispanic White: 0: no, 1: yes; Hispanic: 0: no, 1: yes; non-Hispanic Asian: 0: no, 1: yes; non-Hispanic other race: 0: no, 1: yes); ***First birth*** (0: no, 1: yes); ***Maternal age*** (continuous); ***Born outside of the US*** (0: no, 1: yes); ***Married*** (0: no, 1: yes); ***mother smoked during pregnancy*** (0: no, 1: yes); ***Schooling*** (less than high school: 0: no, 1: yes; high school: 0: no, 1: yes; more than high school: 0: no, 1: yes)?
3. How do I regress ""***probability(low birth weight) = f(age, race/ethnicity, first birth, born outside of US, married, smoked during pregnancy, education)***?""

So I have a bunch of bits of data, some is numerical and some words, and I have the number that the equation produces for each set of data. The data is grouped together, for example let’s say the equation is something like this (I have little idea what it actually looks like): 3w + 4y + 10k = number, each set of data contains w, y, k, and the end result. What makes this challenging is that I’m working with a 5 part polynomial and while some of my data is numerical (in our above example my data for w could be 4 or something) some isn’t (y could be the word “green”) now obviously it must get converted to a number at some point, but it certainly mucks things up. Luckily at most there are only 3 possible values of y in my data set. This is not something I can do on paper, so I’m going to need technological assistance. I’m pretty competent with computers (one of my majors is CS), but I can’t seem to think of any fantastic solution. I think I’m just going to have to brute force it, but I frankly have no idea how to go about doing that.

I have been reading through many of the posts on this subreddit and can see a lot of helpful resources and suggestions, however I am finding it hard to figure which learning would be the best for me. 

For context, I am currently working in an administrative role at a financial sector company, in the finance department. 

I have decided to pursue Data Analysis as my career path, as after researching the job roles and content and identifying that this would be an area I believe I could (eventually) succeed in.

After using google to see how would be best to begin my journey, a few months ago I began learning SQL and have learnt to very basics via YouTube tutorials and little bit of practice using open data sets (by very basics I mean mainly using select functions, joins etc.). 

After completing an introduction in SQL, I enrolled on a data analytics for business intelligence course on Udemy which I am currently progressing with and finding quite useful.

I have also began learning the basics of Python, using the freecodecamp.org tutorial on YouTube. 

Although I am progressing with learning these different areas, I am finding that this progression feels as thought it is moving quite slowly and I am having to go back through tutorials and lessons to try and consolidate my learning, which is becoming a common occurrence. 

My questions to the group are: 

1. What is the best way for a beginner to start developing their actual practical skills in SQL and Python for Data Analysis? 

2. From watching some videos and doing research, it would seem the main Python libraries for data analysis are Matplotlib, pandas and numpy. Do you need to have a solid understanding of ALL of the basics of Python to use these libraries, or are these something you could learn specifically?
 
3. What key concepts are the most important to understand in terms of mathematics and statistics that might help me to develop a greater understanding of how to analyse data?

Thank you all for your time :)"

2. If you were hiring someone, or if you've seen entry level data analysis on-board with your company, what level of work are they doing with R?

I’m on my last semester of college receiving a BA in Statistics. I changed my major three times, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do until a year ago.

I only received one phone screening after applying to around 50 places, and then stopped to just focus on my education and gaining more skills to add to my resume. 

It’s been a year, I have more skills, and college is almost over. The past 3 months I’ve applied to at least 150 places and haven’t received a SINGLE call back. I’ve spiced up my LinkedIn, I’ve added a project I did on GitHub, and I just feel so defeated. 

My boyfriend works in tech, and he’s helped me tremendously with my resume, my skills, and teaching me more about GitHub. Regardless, I still haven’t gotten any calls, only rejections, from internships and entry level data analytics positions. 

Is anyone else having similar problems right now? I’ve even been applying to remote jobs that aren’t in my area just so I can have more chances of getting a job. What’s the point of getting an internship to gain experience, when I’m constantly rejected for not having enough? 

A lot of the internships I look at won’t even take me because I’m graduating so soon. I will continue to gain more skills on my own before I graduate, but not having any experience with phone screenings or interviews also makes me nervous for my future."

 I need suggestions from you my expert fellows regarding the following use case.   


 Yesterday, I got a project from my Upwork Client, he wanted to best present his data in some visualizations so he can compare the data of coronavirus vaccine by the share of the population that has gotten at least one shot in the US states.  

.He was interested in using something intuitive rather than ancient bar charts.

After a research of several hours, I’ve been able to find a tool that provides very useful visualizations in MS Excel and Google Sheets and I've created this visualization using it within no time, I need a second opinion if it’s good to go or not?

What do you guys think about this chart? Any suggestions?

And while I'm learning great stuff (currently working through Beginner Python) I've realized I should probably ask someone if I'm going about this the right way.

* Have a question (say, about Bike Share usage)
* Find or pull together data
* Punch it into Tableau
* Present it through a blog or in a portfolio as ""things I can do.""

The path I'm assuming I'll take is, do some web-scraping with Python, get it into Excel where I'm comfortable at cleaning and formalizing data, using Tableau to make it digestible for the public, and writing up my thoughts on it in a non-professional blog that I'd hope to cite on job interviews. 

**Here are my questions:**

* Are there any other software programs you'd suggest I learn?
   * *I'm going to learn something after Python, and it doesn't have to be related (GIS, Photoshop, a Salesforce cert. etc) but if there's some major thing I am missing, I'd like to prioritize that*
* If you work or hire with DAs, is this something that would be worth doing? 
   * *i.e. If I had, say, 10 DataViz that I created based on data I pulled, would that be impressive or standard and unremarkable?*
* A general question about R. I used it in a graduate program, but it was a real struggle, and I celebrated heavily the day I passed that stats course. Is this something I just need to get better at? Or can I get by with Excel and Python?"

Hi all, I graduated in April with a degree in data analytics, was unfortunately unable to get an internship before graduation (life), then the pandemic hit. After months of searching for an internship, university program, or a full time job, and networking, I took a job not in my field to make ends meet (I was unemployed during this time). Now I'm trying to get back into finding a job in my field, but I'm afraid that my skills are getting rusty. I did a few Udemy courses, but that doesn't seem to impress potential employers. I was thinking about trying to do some volunteer work as a data analyst, but I don't have experience and it's been a while since I've been in school.

* The price does not vary month by month. I am plotting all Qashqais for sale only.  
 
* All Qashqais that are less than the market average (based on my limited dataset) will be highlighted in green, and the best deals are ranked 1-5.  
 
* A fair price is calculated using the forecast() function and uses interpolation to determine what is a fair price of the Qashqai based on it's mileage and previous Qashqais mileage/Price.

So I'm working with some data for a sports team.  There are some criteria that the team needs to hit.  For example, if a football team has 200 players, in a given week 68% of them need to have attended the weight room in order for the team to get a bonus.  If only 67.5% of the team attends, would you round that up to 68% and say that the team met the criteria?

My initial thought is that you would NOT round that number up.  I would say that the team did not hit the criteria.   In this specific case, since .5% of the team actually accounts for 1 player, it's a little bit easier to see, because you can actually say that 1 additional player should have attended.

But I'm running into issues when dealing with populations less than 200.  Where the maximum rounding of .5% would result in less than 1 person.  Would it make sense in this case to round up the percentage?

I also see a lot of articles online that if you are dealing with people in your data, then you should round up, but my thought was this only applies to descriptive statistics about the population.  Like looking at averages.

And then obviously taking this larger, any population larger than 200 would also result in the rounding error accounting for more than 1 person, which just sounds like a bad practice to me."

The number of ways something can be done incorrectly and not noticed is the most profound impression I've had not only from my own work but when looking at errors in databases and work from others. 

From my perspective, *the biggest piece of advice I could give is this*:

1. **Assume all of your data operations and assumptions are wrong**. 
2. **Re-examine your operations and assumptions with systematic scrutiny.**
3. **Then, move on with confidence after fixing errors.**

The trouble with analysis is that it's not very self-checking. If you had an error in any piece of query, code, formula or data assumption then everything built on that is wrong. And if you only run the analysis once, you will not know it. Unless your final output can be compared to an objective, known value, then each step you take should be double checked!

Do not build work on an unknown mistake upstream in your workflow!

Just a random thought! Hope it helps someone."

What advice is there to have the infrastructure to make this an easy thing to pull together? What data structures, tools, etc would you use in an ideal set up?

Below is how I currently set it up each time, so feel free to critique away. 

______________________________________________

Currently I am starting with the list of customers and their first engagement date. Then I am adding a column that counts a Service Ledger table for the number of a given service within a given time period from the costumers first engage date (I.e. jimmy got this service 4 times in 6 months). I have one of those columns for each service and each time period needed for whatever question is being asked, which adds up very quickly (often expands to 40-60 columns).

The problem is that I don't really like front-end part, and all my charts look like these:

[Sample Chart](https://preview.redd.it/n4wu8ds1rui61.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32f6c72c7d8f52907320edf596221dfa5b891a94)

As you can see, those are extremely simple ways of linear data representation. Basically, I just built a JavaScript wrapper which uses Chart.js to draw the data from my database.

What I need is a solution (I eagerly consider paid solutions as well), software, tool, whatever, which will provide me charts with advanced data representation and tools. A good example of what I'd like to have at best is MetaTrader:

As you can see, there're lots of useful tools for data analysis. The FOREX server just sends data about ticks, but the client can manage this data into different timeframes (M1, M5, D1, etc.), can represent as three different chart types (linear, candles, bars), and it also allows you to draw custom lines, arrows, shapes.

The problem with MT5 (MetaTrader) is that it's focused on their internal data providers, and their new functionality for creating custom charts (symbols) is too amateur and, as I could state it, too ""beta"" to consider it in earnest.

The primary requirements are:

\- my back-end script is just sending data, and the client can convert it to different timeframes, candles, etc., so my bare minimum job as a developer is to just write a data providing script

\- data is provided via web-server in real-time, it's not just a file with data, it's real-time ticks that represent data changes every X seconds. So, anything like Excel which hardly works with real-time data sync won't work for me.

P. S.

In case if the images are still processing for you (often happens with reddit last time):

1 - simple chart that I could produce in a pinch by my hands, because I'm mostly back-end, not front-end developer

2 - example of powerful chart that I need: timeframes, different chart types, etc."

I have done some pretty basic A/B testing in the past but that was never something I had to know a lot about, but this role involves more of that so I am a little curious about optimizing with multivariate compared to A/B.

The question is:

They have 1 exiting and 4 new videos, 1 existing and 3 new text contents, so a total of 20 combinations. You can test 4 combinations every time. How do you design the testing to make sure the best combination is find. 

Would love to know how folks with more experience in this area will handle this, or any tips on multivariate testing in general compared to simple A/B testing.

The company wasn't very data driven so I may only be able to gather last year information, it's ok for my manager since we can adjust because of covid. 

What I'm not capable to understand is what approach should i have. We have more than 50 locations, more than 1200 different replaceable parts changed at least once.


Having all the reservations information for the last year and the list of parts we changed per location what should be my approach here ? Can I use this approach to forecast the needs of our vehicles? How should I present my findings? Dashboard? 

I know how to use excel, python, tableau and power bi.

I am currently working on a research paper  with my supervisor. It's a primarily a qualitative study but we want to include a quantitative analysis of our findings. The data is structured in such a way, that there are individual data points that were evaluated on three variables. These variables can have two or three values each (low - medium - high; low - high). For example:

*Event                   V1         V2               V3*

1. high     medium    high
2. low       low             high

We want to explain the variable V1 with V2 and V3. We know from the data, that   
  \- when V2 is high, V1 is sometimes high, but also medium or low  
  \- when V3 is high, V1 is always high  
  \- when V2 and V3 are high, V1 is (almost) always high  
    
We would like to use either an ordered logistic regression (V1:low, medium, high) or logistic regression (V1: low + medium, high) to show that V3 is necessary for V2 to predict the value of V1. 

I have been using R  and the glm function but have had little success, with widely varying values based on which values I used for high / low.

So my questions are: 

**1) Is it even possible to do this type of regression with only discrete values?**

**2) How would one go about it?**

\-             Sales $ by Operating Group by customer by month

\-             Invoice count by Region by customer

\-             Identify the most profitable customer (explain your thought process)

One of this issues I'm having, is that this data is all over the place (which I'm sure is part of the point). Many of the Customers only have 1 or 2 invoices. How should I go about forecasting with such little data? Should I create what-if scenarios?

Sorry if this question has already been asked, but Ive read all types of answers and wanted to recieve some feedback for my situation.

I work in retail, analysing sales and stock data, after that i have to make some scorecards for diferent clients.Up till now, im doing all my reports in excel, and all of them consist on downloading info from clients B2B portals (in data separated by commas), puting all that into a big excel, with lots of tabs, and finally making a ""Data sheet"" with the info I really need, so then I can turn that into a Dynamic Table or Graph.

My problem is, those files are big and chunky (60mb), with 200k lines and 30-40 columns in some tabs, plus lots of columns made of vlookups to external or internal data, and that kind of formulas to make all happen. All this summed up makes my computer and excel crash or be very slow all the time, plus i feel it could be ""more"" automatized.

So here comes my question, **What should I learn: Power BI or Python Pandas (or other thing).**

What I would like to do, is make all my reports easier to set up, lighter and interactive. All the output data (Graphs and Tables) be exportable to an Excel, because all the people in my work use excel and nothing else. Basically, reduce my time making reports and having more time to actually analyse the data.I started today the tutorial of Brandon Rhodes for Python Pandas, but still not sure its the best way for me and my line of work. Ideally I would like to be able to start transfering some reports soon(ish) to the new way.

Sorry for the long post! Will be happy to hear what you think guys or if you have any specific question."

So I've designed a study for my dissertation/honours project to investigate how age (18, 40), offence (attempted murder), and diagnosis (schizophrenia, no diagnosis) influence somebodies likelihood to favour rehabilitation/punishment. So this is obviously a 2X2X2, however, I put them into 8 different vignettes and manipulated that between subjects. Each subject saw 3 random vignettes (but was always exposed to both levels of all variables) 

Can I just run it through SPSS as a 3-way within ANOVA, as each participant is exposed to all levels of the IVs? 
Should I collapse all variables into their 8 vignettes, and then run 2 tests the vignettes with only 1 variable difference (I.e. 1a, 2a, 3a with 1a, 2a, 3b) and 'assume' the difference is a result of the different level of the variable and  just run lots of t-tests?

This is ultimately for a dissertation, so the analysis doesn't need to be super complex, it just needs to answer how each level influences the rehabilitation/punishment response.

Thank you guys!!"

I’m looking for some advice on how to steer my career into a Data Analyst position, when I’m really not qualified.

In summary, I’ve backed myself into a corner in my current ‘data’ role by being reasonably good at Excel (my company is really bad at using data). 

Part of my job is doing data analysis of customer data for clients, which I do using excel and writing up reports. The rest of my time is using our custom database software to import/validate data and fixing problems in excel (i.e. identifying where there’s an initial not a forename, overseas postcodes are the most simple things... it does get more complex). I’ve become ‘indispensable’ to the area of the business for the second part and that limits my learning time.  

I enjoy the analysis side (I’m good at presenting/discussing to/with clients and I get a thrill out of the analysis itself and writing the reports) and would like to move into a specialised data analyst role.

The problem is my degrees (undergrad and MA) are in humanities, and I don’t programme, and basically have no qualifications even for my current job, for which I earn £35k. I can’t take a step down salary-wise and I don’t really want to take a step sideways. I can’t go back to uni or take out more student loads or afford to pay for courses outright. I am a quick and willing learner aside from this. 

Is this a hopeless case? 

If not, are there any analyst roles more likely to fit me (e.g. business analyst vs marketing analyst)? Is there a good place to start for free/cheap learning that would recommended me to employers for non-junior positions? I have wondered if I learnt the basics of SQL or R it would help, but is that too little?

I hope not to cause offence to any data analysts reading this!"

I created the tool based on my own experience transitioning from consulting to a tech company, where I had to learn essential data skills from scratch.

To get started, I reached out to the data/tech director for a mid-size PAC (after finding them on LinkedIn) and asked if they had any data volunteering opportunities.  If you can't find this person, reach out to anyone in the campaign and ask if they know who to talk to.  Within a few days they had me sign an NDA and I was working on getting insights out of their textbanking data - figuring out which messaging was working best, weeding out phone numbers that volunteers should have added to the opt-out list but didn't, etc.  

This can be a great way to build a few industry connections, learn some skills about working within real data infrastructure, and have a killer resume bullet point."

I use whatever tools my company provide. What I want to do is try to find project requests from outside of my company and basically work in reporting as a freelancer.

I  know there are online courses and videos on Udemy or that Google just  launched their own data analyst course, but I'm not good with  self-learning and need the structure of a course with deadlines and  things like that.

So I've checked  out a 6 months online course in my country (Spain) which is not too  expensive and that it promises to lay the foundations of big data  analytics (Python, NoSQL, Hadoop, Spark, MongoDB). The course is project  based, which I think is indispensable, but it doesn't offer any  official certification.

What do  you think? Is it possible to find a job after a 6 months big data  foundations course that more or less touches everything? What could I  add on my own while I study the course so I'm better prepared for the  job market?

Till here with Marcos ([u/marcosfmfr](https://www.reddit.com/u/marcosfmfr/)) and JP ([u/jpmfribeiro](https://www.reddit.com/u/jpmfribeiro/)). We are building a Natural Language BI solution that works on top of any SQL database: [https://www.veezoo.com](https://www.veezoo.com/)

We've founded Veezoo in 2016 as a Spin-off from the ETH Zurich based on our research on Knowledge Graphs and Question/Answer interfaces to databases. Veezoo challenges the traditional way to do BI by enabling companies to explore and visualize data by simply asking natural language questions.

For the data team, we offer a modelling language based on SQL with version control, so you can actually keep track of all your configuration. The modelling language VKL (Veezoo Knowledge Language, similar to LookML) is a powerful semantic layer on top of your data.

VKL allows you to model your data semantically, without the need to change the underlying structure of your database. Also all kind of Business Logic / Rules can be defined there. Nowadays we get more and more competition from big and small players. Our main differentiation is the relentless focus on making sure that even complex natural language questions can be answered correctly.

When we first started out five years ago, we wanted to build a completely Self-Service, cloud native version of Veezoo.

But up until now we have never built one, as we prioritized our resources to making sure Veezoo runs well for enterprise clients (e.g. AXA insurance). There we have around 2'000 users asking over 25'000 questions every month in 4 different languages (English, German, French &amp; Italian).

This is the first time we are offering a Self-Service Veezoo to the general public, so we know we have a lot to learn and improve!

Here's a narrated 4-min video showing you the whole integration process from raw data to getting answers:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBI5SAFEJtg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBI5SAFEJtg)

Give it a spin (with our demo data or your own) with no obligations / for free:

We would love to hear what you think about our solution. Happy to answer any question you might have."
